# Building MonetDB from source

## Summary

For cmake, you should always build the code in a separate directory, say "build". This directory should be OUTSIDE of the source code tree. The results of the build are stored in this directory. The location on the filesystem is not important, as long as you have permissions to write in that location.

Assuming the monetdb source code is checked out in  directory "/path/to/monetdb/source". And if you have all the required packages (See below) to build MonetDB, these are the set of commands  to build and *install* it from source. Install is one of the predefined targets [install, test, mtest]. When you test monetdb, you will likely not want to install it in the default location, the standard GNU directory structure. So you want to set the install prefix variable when generating the build system, using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/monetdb /path/to/monetdb/source
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

## Prerequisites

## Testing
For testing, you likely don't want to install in the default location, so you need to add the installation prefix parameter to the cmake command. But you do not need any configuration to run mtest (on Linux). Just run the command:

```
cmake --build . --target mtest
```

## Configuration options

The way options interact with building of the MonetDB source has fundamentally changed from the way this was done using the autotools buildsystem. Now almost all options are on by default. And these options mostly control library detection. In the old system, it was possible to build a subset of the codebase. For example, you could choose not to build the sql part. Now the every part of the code is build, as long as the dependent libraries are detected. And by default, the system would try to detect all dependent libraries. If your system does not have a required library, that section of the code will not be build. Only if you want to prevent the build of a certain section, you could use the option to prevent that a dependency is detected.

Evidently there are several options to control as illustrated in $SOURCE/cmake/monetdb-options.cmake

The important once to choose from are -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE, which takes the value Release or Debug.
The former creates the binary ready for shipping, including all compiler optimizations that come with it.
The Debug mode is necessary if you plan to debug the binary and needs access to the symbol tables.
This build type also typically leads to a slower execution time, because also all kinds of assertions
are being checked.

Other  relevant properties are also -DASSERT=ON and DSTRICT=ON, used in combination with a Debug build, e.g.

```
CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DASSERT=ON -DSTRICT=ON"
mkdir build
cd build
cmake $CONFIGURE_OPTIONS -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/monetdb /path/to/monetdb/source
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```
