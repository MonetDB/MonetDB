Description: MonetDB core library
 MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
 main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
 automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
 accelerators.  It also has an SQL frontend.
 .
 This package contains the core components of MonetDB in the form of a
 single shared library.  If you want to use MonetDB, you will certainly
 need this package, but you will also need at least the monetdb5-server
 package, and most likely also monetdb5-sql, as well as one or
 more client packages.
