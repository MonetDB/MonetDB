monetdb (11.39.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * odbc: When connecting using a DSN (Data Source Name), information about the
    data source is retrieved from the ODBC.INI file.  Now we also get the
    location of the LOGFILE from this file.  The logfile can be used to
    log all calls to the MonetDB ODBC driver to a file which can be used
    for debugging.

monetdb (11.39.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * odbc: The ODBC driver now only passes on information about HUGEINT columns
    as HUGEINT when the application has indicated interest by querying
    about the SQL_HUGEINT extension type using the SQLGetTypeInfo
    function or by specifying the type in a call to SQLSetDescField.
    Otherwise the driver silently translates the HUGEINT type to BIGINT.
    This means that most application will see BIGINT columns when the
    server produced a HUGEINT column and only give an error if the value
    in the HUGEINT column didn't fit into a BIGINT.

monetdb (11.39.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * monetdb5: The settings for specifying how mserver5 should listen to "The
    Internet" have been overhauled.  See the manual for details.  In
    brief, mapi_autosense, mapi_ipv6 and mapi_open are gone.  If
    mapi_listenaddr equals "localhost" or "all", we listen to both IPv4
    and IPv6 (if available), if "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0", we listen to
    IPv4 only, if "::1" or "::" we listen to IPv6 only.  The first of
    each pair is loopback interface only, the second is all interfaces.
    If mapi_listenaddr is "none", then no IP port is opened, you need to
    use a UNIX domain socket.  If mapi_port is 0, we let the operating
    system choose a free port (like mapi_autosense).  Default behavior
    has not changed.

monetdb (11.39.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MonetDB: Finished a first version of the new monitoring function
    user_statistics(), which is only intended for the DBAs.
    For each database user who has logged in during the current mserver5
    session, it returns
    "username": login name of the database user,
    "querycount": the number of queries this user has executed since his/her
        first login,
    "totalticks": the total execution time (in microsecond) of the queries ran
        by this user,
    "maxquery": the query with the longest execution time (if two queries have
        the same execution time, the newer overwrites the older),
    "maxticks": the execution time of the 'maxquery' (in microsecond),
    "started": the start timestamp of the 'maxquery',
    "finished": the finish timestamp of the 'maxquery'.

monetdb (11.39.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: Removed compatibility between interval types and other numeric types in
    favor for a more strict SQL standard compliance. This means operations
    between temporal types and other numeric types such as INT and
    DECIMAL are no longer possible, instead use interval types.
    e.g. SELECT date '2020-01-01' + 1; now gives the error. Instead do:
    SELECT date '2020-01-01' + interval '1' day; if 1 was meant to be a
    day interval.
    Setting an interval variable such as the session's current timezone
    with a number e.g. SET current_timezone = 1; is no longer possible.
    Instead do SET current_timezone = interval '1' hour;
    Casting between interval and other numeric types is no longer possible
    as well, because they are not compatible.
  * sql: Because of incompatibilities this change may create, if a user intends
    to convert a numeric value to an interval, the multiplication function
    can be used in the form: <numeric value> * interval '1' <interval length>
    e.g. 10 * interval '1' second = interval '10' second.
    As for the other way around, the 'EPOCH' option was added to the extract
    syntax. This option returns the number of milliseconds since the UNIX
    epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for date, timestamp and time values (it
    can be negative). Meanwhile, for day and second intervals, it returns the
    total number of milliseconds in the interval. As a side note, the 'EPOCH'
    option is not available for month intervals, because this conversion is
    not transparent for this type.

monetdb (11.39.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: Removed '@' syntax used to refer into a variable in a query. It
    was a non-standard method, which was replaced by a schema addition to
    variables. Variables in the global scope now have schema. All default
    global variables are set under schema "sys". However variables
    inside PSM don't have a schema, because there are no transaction
    semantics inside PSM at the moment.
  * sql: Removed declared variables and tables from the global scope. They were
    transaction agnostic and incompatible with the SQL standard, i.e. they
    are valid exclusively under PSM (e.g. functions, procedures and
    triggers).
  * sql: Scoping semantics were added for both variables and tables. Variables
    with the same name at a query are now resolved under the following
    precedence rules:
      1. Tables, Views and CTEs at the FROM clause.
      2. Variable declared in the body of function/procedure, i.e. local
         variable.
      3. Function/procedure parameter.
      4. Variable from the global scope.
    Tables with the same name now have the following precedence rules at a
    SQL query:
      1. Table declared in the body of function/procedure, ie local table.
      2. Temporary table.
      3. Table from the current session schema.
    This means the query: SELECT * FROM "keys"; will list keys from
    temporary tables instead of persisted ones, because "keys" table
    is available for both "sys" and "tmp" schemas.
  * sql: The table returning function "var" was extended with more details
    about globally declared variables, namely their schema, type and
    current value.

  * gdk: A new type of candidate list has been introduced.  Candidate lists
    are used internally to specify which rows of a column participate
    in an operation.  Before, candidate lists always contained a list of
    candidate row IDs.  The new candidate list type specifies a list of
    row IDs that should NOT be considered (negative candidates).
  * gdk: The maximum number of BATs in the system has been increased for 64
    bit architectures.
  * gdk: The hash tables used internally by the system now uses a technique
    based on Linear Hashing which allows them to grow gracefully.  This
    means that hash tables aren't removed and recreated nearly as often
    anymore.  This also meant that the hash table had to be split into
    two files, which means that after an upgrade the hash tables have to
    be recreated.

    Optimizer pipeline: sys.setoptimizer(int, string)
    Number of worker threads: sys.setworkerlimit(int, int)
    Memory limits (in MB): sys.setmemorylimit(int, int)
    Query timeout (in ms): sys.setquerytimeout(int, int)
    Session timeout (in ms): sys.setsessiontimeout(int, int)
    The first argument corresponds to the id of the session to modify, and
    these procedures are bound to the monetdb user exclusively.
    The versions of the mentioned procedures with just the second argument were
    added as well, where the changes are reflected in the current user session,
    and therefore every user can call them.
  * sql: The procedures sys.settimeout(bigint), sys.settimeout(bigint,bigint)

    compiled in, snapshots can also be compressed ('/tmp/snapshot.tar.gz').
    The tar file expands to a single directory with the same name as the
    database that was snapshotted. This directory can be passed directly
    as the --dbpath argument of mserver5 or it can be copied into an
    existing dbfarm and started from monetdbd.

monetdb (11.35.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * monetdb5: The mtime module was completely rewritten, the atom types date,
    daytime, and timestamp were changed.  Upgrade code for BATs
    containing these types has been implemented.  The old daytime type
    used a 32 bit integer to record milliseconds since the start of the
    day.  The new daytime type uses a 64 bit integer to record
    microseconds since the start of the day.  The old date type recorded
    days since or before the year 1.  The new daytime type records the
    day of the month and the number of months since the year -4712
    separately in a single 32 bit integer of which only 26 bits are
    used.  Dates now use the proleptic Gregorian calendar, meaning the
    normal Gregorian callendar has been extended backward, and before
    the year 1, we have the year 0.  Both the old and new timestamp
    types are a combination of a daytime and a date value, but since
    those types have changed, the timestamp type has also changed.  The
    new date type has a smaller range than the old.  The new date range
    is from the year -4712 to the year 170049.  During conversion of
    date and timestamp columns, the dates are clamped to this range.

      { UPDATE SET assignment_list | DELETE } } |
    { WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND search_condition ] THEN

monetdb (11.33.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: Improved and extended storagemodel functionality. Changes include:
  * sql: Added views sys."tablestorage" and sys."schemastorage" for easy and
    quick assesment of aggregated storage usage per table or per schema.
  * sql: Excluded listing system tables in views sys."storage", sys."tablestorage"
    and sys."schemastorage". You can still use sys."storage"() to query
    storage of system tables and columns.
  * sql: In procedure sys.storagemodelinit() when populating table
    sys.storagemodelinput it now excludes system tables as system tables are
    not useful to be modeled for storagesize by application users.
    It now also computes and populates the atomwidth column more correctly
    for variable size data types (strings, blobs) when the table has
    representative data in those columns.
  * sql: System function sys.columnsize() has been corrected for types: tinyint,
    real, date, time, timetz, sec_interval, month_interval, decimal, uuid,
    mbr, char, clob, json, url, blob, geometry and geometrya.
    For variable size data types (varchar, char, clob, json, url, blob,
    geometry, geometrya) it now returns the columnsize excluding the
    variable heapsize. The heapsize is retrievable via sys.heapsize().
  * sql: System function sys.heapsize() has been corrected for all variable size
    data types: varchar, char, clob, json, url, blob, geometry and geometrya.
  * sql: System function sys.imprintsize() has been corrected. The imprintsize
    depends on the width (1 or 2 or 4 or 8 or 16 bytes) of the data type.
    Also instead of 12% it now uses 20%, which is a better estimate.
  * sql: System function sys.storagemodel() has been removed as it outputs the
    same data as view sys.storagemodel. Use view sys.storagemodel instead.
  * sql: Corrected views sys.storagemodel and sys.tablestoragemodel by returning
    a computed orderidxsize when the count has been changed in the
    sys.storagemodelinput table.  Also the views now return data ordered
    by schema, table and column names.
  * sql: Extended view sys.tablestoragemodel with column: "storages". Besides
    columns also keys (primary, foreign and unique keys) and indexes
    (ordered, imprints) use storage, so the "storages" count can be higher
    than the number of columns per table.
  * sql: Corrected the data type of columns "schema", "table", "column", "type",
    "mode" and location in table sys.storagemodelinput and functions
    sys."storage"(), sys."storage"(sname), sys."storage"(sname, tname)
    and sys."storage"(sname, tname, cname) from string into varchar(1024).
    Consequently also the views based on the table or functions will be
    reporting varchar(1024) as column meta data instead of clob for those
    columns.  This allows faster querying and reporting by generic SQL
    programs which treat clob querying different from varchar columns.

monetdb (11.33.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: Extended windowing functions catalog with SQL standard semantics.
    Standard aggregation functions can now be used in windowing
    functions: (avg,max,min,sum,prod,count). Other windowing specific
    functions were also implemented: (percent_rank,cume_dist,ntile,
    lag,lead,first_value,last_value,nth_value).
  * sql: The standard frame specification was implemented for aggregation
    functions as well as first_value, last_value and nth_value
    functions. The available frames are rows, range and groups.
    Bounds can be unbounded (partition limit), the current row, a fixed
    number of rows (constant), or variable (column as input).
    (e.g SELECT COUNT(col1) OVER (PARTITION BY col2 ORDER BY col3 RANGE
    BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) FROM t1;).
  * sql: Added WINDOW keyword which is optionally provided after the FROM
    clause, with window specifications used in the projection
    (e.g SELECT SUM(col1) OVER w1, LAST_VALUE(col2) OVER w2 FROM t1
    WINDOW w1 AS (ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 0 FOLLOWING),
    w2 AS (w1);).
  * sql: Our previous partitioning implementation didn’t impose order in the
    input. With this reexamination, partitioning now imposes ascending
    order by default, thus pairing with the industry standard
    implementation.

    the client instead of doing it in the server.  This has the
    advantage that COPY INTO is then no longer restricted to only the
    "super user" monetdb, nor only to absolute file names.  The syntax
    to have the server communicate with the client for file content is
    COPY INTO table FROM file ON CLIENT ...; and COPY query INTO file ON
    CLIENT ...;.  This also works for COPY BINARY INTO.  There is also
    the possibility to specify that files are to be read/written by the
    server by using ON SERVER.  This is also the default when ON CLIENT
    or ON SERVER is not specified.

  * stream: The functions mnstr_write{Sht,Int,Lng,Hge} and their Array variants
    now swap bytes of the written values if the stream is set to swap bytes
    (i.e. big-endian on a little-endian machine and v.v.).
  * stream: Removed defines ST_ASCII, ST_BIN, ST_READ, ST_WRITE from stream.h.
  * stream: Changed function mnstr_set_byteorder(stream, char) to
    mnstr_set_bigendian(stream, bool) where the second argument should
    be `true' for specifying that the stream is bigendian.  This sets an
    internal flag whether or not to swap bytes which can be retrieved
    with mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream).
  * stream: Changed function `int mnstr_byteorder(stream)' to `bool
    mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream)'; it now returns whether bytes are
    swapped.
  * stream: Changed function `int mnstr_type(stream)' to `bool
    mnstr_isbinary(stream)'.

  * sql: Extended merge tables with partitioning using a predicate:
    > CREATE MERGE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (... columns ...)
    [ PARTITION BY { RANGE | VALUES }
    { ON '(' column_name ')' | USING '(' expression ')' } ]
    The partitioning can occur by range or list of values using one of
    the table's columns or an expression. The domain of the partitioning
    scheme will be covered by each child table added with alter statements
    depending if the table is partitioned by range or list of values:
    > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
    AS PARTITION IN '(' expression [ ',' ... ] ')' [ WITH NULL ]
    > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
    AS PARTITION BETWEEN { RANGE MINVALUE | expression } AND
    { RANGE MAXVALUE | expression } [ WITH NULL ]
    > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
    AS PARTITION WITH NULL
    When updating a single partition range/list of values, the SET
    keyword should be used instead of ADD.
    INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements are possible on partitioned
    tables with corresponding validation on each partition domain.
    The system tables sys.table_partitions, sys.range_partitions and
    sys.value_partitions were added to store meta-information about
    each existing partition.

    recorded pid is running. If not, we start stethoscope, assuming that
    something went wrong before.
  * merovingian: Changed the monetdb stop command to try to stop stethoscope before
    stoping the server. The error conditions that can arrise from attempting
    to stop stethoscope are:
    - The database is not running.
    - The profilerlogpath is not set.
    - The profiler.pid file does not exist or is inaccessible.
    - The contents of the profiler.pid are not valid.
    - Shutdown of stethoscope did not succeed.
    - Removing the profiler.pid file failed.
    In all the cases, the attempt to stop the server can continue normally,
    so we actually ignore any errors that rise from the attempt to stop
    stethoscope.

  * MonetDB: mclient's execution time profiling options and output format have
    been changed. Instead of implicitly via the "--interactive"/"-i"
    option (or when using an interactive mclient console), execution time
    profiling is now controlled via an explicit "--timer=timermode"/"-t
    timermode" command-line option, or a "\t timermode" command in the
    interactive mclient console. The default (also in the interactive
    mclient console) is now timermode "none", i.e., no timing information
    is given. Timermode "clock" activates client-side wall-clock timing
    ("clk") in "human-friendly" format much like the interactive mode did
    before. Timermode "performance" also provides detailed server-side
    timings: "sql" is the time to parse the SQL query, optimize the
    logical relational plan and create the initial physical (MAL) plan;
    "opt" is the time to optimize the physical (MAL) plan; "run" is the
    time to execute the physical (MAL) plan. With timermode "performance"
    all server-side timings and the client-side wall-clock time are given
    in milliseconds (ms). Note that the client-measured wall-clock time
    "clk" is reported per query only when options "--interactive" or
    "--echo" are used, because only then does mclient send individual
    lines (statements) of the SQL script to the server. Otherwise, mclient
    sends the SQL script in large(r) batch(es) to the server, and, thus,
    only the total wall-clock time per batch is measured and reported. The
    server-measured detailed performance timings "sql", "opt", "run" are
    always measured and reported per query. Also, all timing information
    is now given on a separate line and sent to stderr rather than stdout.

    "ulng" have been moved and can therefore no longer be used by code
    that doesn't (ultimately) include gdk.h.  Just use int64_t instead.
    A bunch of format defines have been removed: SZFMT, SSZFMT, PTRFMT,
    PDFMT.  Just use the C standard codes for those (%zu, %zd, %p, %td).
    The define for printing a lng (LLFMT) was also moved.  Use PRId64 for
    printing int64_t in code not using gdk.h.  Removed all references to
    __int64 and long long (use int64_t instead).

          qname IS { 'my description text' | NULL | '' } ;
    For COLUMN the qname can be "table_name"."column_name" or fully qualified
    as in: "schema_name"."table_name"."column_name".
    For FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, AGGREGATE, FILTER FUNCTION and LOADER the qname
    may need to include the signature (argument types) to be able to
    differentiate between multiple overloaded functions which have the same name
    and schema.
    By specifying IS NULL or IS '' you remove the comment for the database object.
    If a database object is dropped, the associated comment is also removed.
    Note: it is not allowed or possible to add comments for temporary tables or
          objects in schema "tmp".
    The sql catalog has been extended with system table: sys.comments.
    The keyword 'COMMENT' has now become a reserved keyword.

    In a TRUNCATE statement a 'CONTINUE IDENTITY' or 'RESTART IDENTITY'
    clause can be passed to restart or not, being the former the default one.
    The 'CASCADE' option instructs to truncate referencing table(s) also if
    the referencing table(s) have foreign key references to this table.
    The default behavior is 'RESTRICT'.
    Note: it is possible to use TRUNCATE statements in a transaction and
    thus to rollback the effects of a truncate.
    The keywords 'TRUNCATE' and 'CONTINUE' have now become reserved keywords.
  * sql: Added possibility to GRANT or REVOKE a TRUNCATE privilege to a user or role.
  * sql: Added possibility to define a TRIGGER on a TRUNCATE event.

    protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when
    transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports
    compression using Snappy or LZ4.

monetdb (11.19.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * clients: Changes to the Perl interface, thanks to Stefan O'Rear:
    1. removes "use sigtrap", because this has global effects and should
    not be used by modules, only by the application.
    2. allows Perl 5.8.1+ Unicode strings to be passed to quote() and
    included in statements (UTF-8 encoded, as expected by Monet's str
    module)
    3. quote and unquote now use the same quoting rules as the MonetDB
    server, allowing for all characters except NUL to be round-tripped
    4. several character loops have been reimplemented in regex for much
    greater performance
    5. micro-optimizations to the result fetch loop
    6. block boundaries are preserved in piggyback data so that Xclose is
    not appended or prepended to a SQL command
    7. diagnostic messages #foo before a result header are ignored, this
    is necessary to use recycler_pipe
    8. fail quickly and loudly if we receive a continuation prompt (or any
    other response that starts with a non-ASCII character)
    9. header lines must start with %, not merely contain %, fixing a bug
    when querying a table where string values contain %
    10. after closing a large resultset, account for the fact that a reply
    will come and do not lose sync
    11. allow a MAPI_TRACE environment variable to dump wire protocol
    frames to standard output
    12. fixes maximum MAPI block size to match the server limit of 16k.
    previously would crash on blocks larger than 16k

  * testing: enabled "top-level" Mtest.py
    So far, while Mtest.py could be called in any subdirectory of the MonetDB
    source tree (and could then run all tests in the entire sub-tree),
    it was not possible to call Mtest.py in the top-level MonetDB source
    directory to run all tests.  Instead, to run all tests, Mtest.py had to
    be called at least 4 times, once in each of these directories: "clients",
    "monetdb5", "sql", "geom".
    Now, it is possible to call Mtest.py once in the top-level MonetDB source
    directory to run all tests in one go.
    The behaviour of calling Mtest.py in any subdirectory, including the
    four mentioned above, did not changed, other than that now obsolete
    command line options "-p / --package <package>" and "-5 / --monetdb5"
    have been removed.

    if either standard input is a terminal, or if the -i option is given.
    The -i option no longer causes mclient to read from standard input.
    It only means to do \ interpretation when reading from standard input.
    Use the - filename argument to read from standard input.  Note that
