  * merovingian: Added handling of a dbextra property per database at the daemon
    level. The user can set the dbextra property for a database using the
    command:  $ monetdb set dbextra=<path> <database> and the daemon will
    make sure to start the new server using the correct
    --dbextra parameter.

monetdb (11.27.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MonetDB: Added a new server-side protocol implementation. The new protocol
    is backwards compatible with the old protocol. Clients can choose
    whether they want to use the old or the new protocol during the initial
    handshake with the server. The new protocol is a binary column-based
    protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when
    transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports
    compression using Snappy or LZ4.

monetdb (11.27.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * gdk: Improved error checking in the logger code (dealing with the write-ahead
    log); changed return types a several functions from int to gdk_return
    (i.e., they now return GDK_SUCCEED or GDK_FAIL).  The logger no longer
    calls GDKfatal on error.  Instead the caller is responsible for dealing
    with errors.

    is not an integer, we now choose the nearest position, favoring the
    lower if the distance to the two adjacent positions is equal (round
    down to nearest integer).

monetdb (11.25.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * gdk: Fixed a bug when appending string bats that are fully duplicate
    eliminated.  It could happend that the to-be-appended bat had an empty
    string at an offset and at that same offset in the to-be-appended-to bat
    there happened to be a (sequence of) NULL(s).  Then this offset would be
    used, even though it might nog be the right offset for the empty string
    in the to-be-appended-to bat.  This would result in multiple offsets for
    the empty string, breaking the promise of being duplicate eliminated.

    their own repositories and release cycles.  The Python client is
    maintained by Gijs Molenaar on Github
    (https://github.com/gijzelaerr/pymonetdb), the other clients are
    maintained by CWI/MonetDB on our own server
    (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-java,
    https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-perl,
    https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-php).

monetdb (11.25.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: The syntax of bat.new(:oid,:any) has been changed by dropping the
    superflous :oid.  All BATs are now binary associations between a void
    column and a materialized value column.  (except for the internal
    :bat[:void,:void] representation of simple oid ranged tails.)

    head column.
  * gdk: The head column is now completely gone.  MonetDB is completely
    "headless".
  * gdk: The format of the BBP.dir file was simplified.  Since the head column
    is VOID, the only value that needs to be stored is the head seqbase.

monetdb (11.25.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * gdk: BATs now only have a single (logical) name.
  * gdk: The function BATmirror is gone.  The HEAD column is always VOID (with
    a non-nil seqbase) and the TAIL column carries the data.  All functions
    that deal with data work on the TAIL column.

  * gdk: Replaced BATseqbase with BAThseqbase and BATtseqbase, the former for
    setting the seqbase on the HEAD, the latter for setting the seqbase
    on the TAIL.

monetdb (11.25.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * gdk: The "wrd" type has been removed from GDK and MAL.  The type was defined
    to be a 32 bit integer on 32 bit architectures and a 64 bit integer

monetdb (11.23.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * java: Corrected PROCEDURE_TYPE output value of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures().
    It used to return procedureReturnsResult. Now it returns procedureNoResult.
    Corrected ORDINAL_POSITION output value of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns().
    It used to start with 0, but as procedures do not return a result value it now
    starts with 1 for all the procedure arguments, as defined by the JDBC API.
  * java: Improved output of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures(). The REMARKS
    column now contains the procedure definition as stored in sys.functions.func.
    The SPECIFIC_NAME column now contains the procedure unique identifier as
    stored in sys.functions.id. This allows the caller to retrieve the specific
    overloaded procedure which has the same name, but different arguments.
    Also improved output of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns().
    The SPECIFIC_NAME column now contains the procedure unique identifier as
    stored in sys.functions.id. This allows the caller to retrieve the proper
    arguments of the specific overloaded procedure by matching the SPECIFIC_NAME
    value.
  * java: Improved output of method DatabaseMetaData.getFunctions(). The REMARKS
    column now contains the function definition as stored in sys.functions.func.
    The SPECIFIC_NAME column now contains the function unique identifier as

  * gdk: BUNdelete and BATdel don't accept a foce argument and only allow
    deleting values that have not yet been committed.  BUNdelete exchanges
    the deleted value with the last value (if the deleted value isn't the

    deleted values up.  The list of to-be-deleted values in BATdel must
    be sorted and unique.
  * gdk: Removed BUNreplace from list of exported functions.  It wasn't used,
    and there is still BUNinplace and void_inplace that do more-or-less
    the same thing.

monetdb (11.19.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * clients: Changes to the Perl interface, thanks to Stefan O'Rear:
    1. removes "use sigtrap", because this has global effects and should
    not be used by modules, only by the application.
    2. allows Perl 5.8.1+ Unicode strings to be passed to quote() and
    included in statements (UTF-8 encoded, as expected by Monet's str
    module)
    3. quote and unquote now use the same quoting rules as the MonetDB
    server, allowing for all characters except NUL to be round-tripped
    4. several character loops have been reimplemented in regex for much
    greater performance
    5. micro-optimizations to the result fetch loop
    6. block boundaries are preserved in piggyback data so that Xclose is
    not appended or prepended to a SQL command
    7. diagnostic messages #foo before a result header are ignored, this
    is necessary to use recycler_pipe
    8. fail quickly and loudly if we receive a continuation prompt (or any
    other response that starts with a non-ASCII character)
    9. header lines must start with %, not merely contain %, fixing a bug
    when querying a table where string values contain %
    10. after closing a large resultset, account for the fact that a reply
    will come and do not lose sync
    11. allow a MAPI_TRACE environment variable to dump wire protocol
    frames to standard output
    12. fixes maximum MAPI block size to match the server limit of 16k.
    previously would crash on blocks larger than 16k

    it was not possible to call Mtest.py in the top-level MonetDB source

    Now, it is possible to call Mtest.py once in the top-level MonetDB source
    directory to run all tests in one go.

    four mentioned above, did not changed, other than that now obsolete

monetdb (11.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * clients: mclient: The exact interpretation of the -i (--interactive) option
    and the - filename argument have changed.  The - filename argument
    means read from standard input and no longer implies that no \
    interpretation is done on the input.  Instead, \ interpretation is done
    if either standard input is a terminal, or if the -i option is given.
    The -i option no longer causes mclient to read from standard input.
    It only means to do \ interpretation when reading from standard input.
    Use the - filename argument to read from standard input.  Note that
    if no -s option is specified and no filename arguments are present,
    mclient still reads from standard input.

    a more stronger authorisation model as used by mclients.  On upgrade,
    any existing passphrase is converted to the hashed version of the
    passphrase.
  * merovingian: The monetdbd controlport option has been removed in favour of a
    boolean control option.  On upgrade, when controlport was set to
    a non-zero value and a passphrase was set, control is set to true,

monetdb (11.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sql: Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
    database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
    databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
    first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
    release.

monetdb (11.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * merovingian: monetdbd can no longer log error and normal messages to separate
    logfiles, logging to stdout and stderr is no longer possible either.
  * merovingian: The .merovingian_pass file is no longer in use, and replaced by the
    .merovingian_properties file.  Use monetdbd (get|set) passphrase to
    view/edit the control passphrase.  Existing .merovingian_pass files
    will automatically be migrated upon startup of monetdbd.
  * merovingian: monetdbd now understands commands that allow to create, start, stop,
    get and set properties on a given dbfarm.  This behaviour is intended
    as primary way to start a MonetDB Database Server, on a given location
    of choice.  monetdbd get and set are the replacement of editing the
    monetdb5.conf file (which is no longer in use as of the Apr2011
    release).  See monetdbd(1).
