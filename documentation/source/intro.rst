The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group
(see https://www.monetdb.org/).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at https://www.monetdb.org/easy-setup/

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB source can be found at our `Mercurial
server`__. There is also a `github mirror`__ that is updated once a day.
