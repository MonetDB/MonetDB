The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group
(see https://www.monetdb.org/).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at https://www.monetdb.org/Downloads/

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB source can be found at our `Mercurial
server`__. There is also a `github mirror`__ that is updated once a day.

.. _MonetDB: https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB/
__ MonetDB_

.. _github: https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB

If you got a source distribution, please compile and install MonetDB first,
following the instructions in the file `HowToStart.rst`__ (for Unix)
or `buildtools/doc/windowsbuild.rst`__ (for Windows).
