NAME
====

mserver5 - the MonetDB server version 5

SYNOPSIS
========

**mserver5** [ *options* ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

*Mserver5* is the current MonetDB server that performs all processing on
request of clients for a certain database.

Note that while *mserver5* is the process that does the actual work, it
is usually more common to start, monitor and connect to the *mserver5*
process through *monetdbd*\ (1).

This man-page describes the options that *mserver5* understands. It is
intended for people who really need to work with *mserver5* itself. In
regular cases, the programs *monetdbd*\ (1) and *monetdb*\ (1) control
the many options, and allow to adjust them to appropriate values where
sensible. For normal usage, it is preferred to apply any configuration
through these programs.

OPERATION
=========

When the build-time configuration did not disable this, a *mserver5*
process presents the user with server startup information and internal
exceptions due to errors in commands sent by clients. The architecture
is setup to handle multiple streams of requests. The first thread
started represents the server, which only writes to standard output.

The server thread started remains in existence until all other threads
die. The server is stopped by sending it a termination signal (SIGINT,
SIGTERM, SIGQUIT).

MSERVER5 OPTIONS
================

*Mserver5* can be started with options as arguments.

**--dbpath=**\ *path*
   Path where *mserver5* should find a database. Shorthand for option
   **gdk_dbpath**. Default value:
   **@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LOCALSTATEDIR@/monetdb5/dbfarm/demo**.

**--dbextra=**\ *path*
   Path where *mserver5* should store transient data. Default value is
   the value of the **--dbpath** option.

**--dbtrace=**\ *path*
   File name for the trace log file for *mserver5*. Default value is the
   file **mdbtrace.log** inside the directory specified with the
   **--dbpath** option.

**--config=**\ *file*
   Config file to read options from. This file can contain all options
   as can be set with the **--set** flag. See *CONFIG FILE FORMAT*.

**--single-user**
   Allow only a single user at a time.

**--readonly**
   The database is opened in read-only mode.

**--set** *option*\ **=**\ *value*
   Set individual configuration option. For possible options, see
   *PARAMETERS* sections.

**--help**
   Print list of options.

**--version**
   Print version and compile configuration.

**--in-memory**
   Run *mserver5* in-memory. **No** data will be persisted.

**--debug**\ [**=**\ *value*]

**-d**\ [*value*]
   Set debug level. This is mostly for debugging purposes. The value is
   an integer, which can be (a bit-wise OR of):

                                no guarantee that the database remains
                                consistent after a crash.  DO NOT USE
                                (unless you really don't care about your
                                data).

                                 cores (threads) available;
                                 this allows us to test mitosis
                                 functionality without requiring large
                                 data sets (— at the expense of a
                                 potentially significant interpretation
                                 overhead for unnecessarily large plans);
                                 used only for development & testing;
                                 set automatically by Mtest.py

The *value* together with the **=** sign is optional. If not specified,
it defaults to **1**. In the short form **-d**, the value, if present,
must immediately (i.e. without space) follow the option. The values of
multiple instances of this flag are OR-ed together.

MSERVER5 PARAMETERS
===================

*Mserver5* instructs the GDK kernel through the MAL (MonetDB Assembler
Language) language. MonetDB 5 contains an extensive optimiser framework
to transform MAL plans into more optimal or functional (e.g.
distributed) plans. These parameters control behaviour on the MAL level.

**monet_vault_key**
   The authorisation tables inside *mserver5* can be encrypted with a
   key, such that reading the BATs does not directly disclose any
   credentials. The **monet_vault_key** setting points to a file that
   stores a secret key to unlock the password vault. It can contain
   anything. The file is read up to the first null-byte (``'\0'``), hence it
   can be padded to any length with trailing null-bytes to obfuscate the
   key length. Generating a key can be done for example by using a tool
   such as *pwgen* and adding a few of the passwords generated. Make
   sure not to choose a too small key. Note that on absence of a vault
   key file, some default key is used to encrypt the authorisation
   tables. Changing this setting (effectively changing the key) for an
   existing database makes that database unusable as noone is any longer
   able to login. If you use *monetdbd*\ (1), a per-database vault key
   is set.

**max_clients**
   Controls how many client slots are allocated for clients to connect.
   This settings limits the maximum number of connected clients at the
   same time. Note that MonetDB is not designed to handle massive
   amounts of connected clients. The funnel capability from
   *monetdbd*\ (1) might be a more suitable solution for such workloads.
   Default **64**.

**mapi_usock**
   The name of the UNIX domain socket file on which the server will
   listen for connections. Note, there is usually a severe
   system-imposed length limitation on the name of the file.

**mapi_port**
   The TCP/IP port number on which the server will listen for
   connections. This is only used if the value of the
   **mapi_listenaddr** option is not equal to **none**. Default
   **50000**. If the value is **0**, the server will use a so called
   ephemeral port, i.e. one that is assigned by the system. After
   successfully starting to listen to a port, the value of the port can
   be retrieved from the file **.conn** inside the database
   (**--dbpath**) directory.

**mapi_listenaddr**
   The TCP/IP interface on which the server will listen for connections.
   Possibilites are:

   **localhost**
      The server listens only on the IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interface.
      This is the default.

   **127.0.0.1**
      The server listens only on the IPv4 loopback interface.

   **::1**
      The server listens only on the IPv6 loopback interface.

   **all**
      The server listens on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.

   **0.0.0.0**
      The server listens on all IPv4 interfaces.

   **::**
      The server listens on all IPv6 interfaces.

   **none**
      The server will not listen on any TCP/IP interface (you need to
      use the UNIX domain socket interface).

   *hostname*
      The server will listen on the interface designated by *hostname*
      which is looked up using the normal hostname lookup facilities.

SQL PARAMETERS
==============

The SQL component of MonetDB 5 runs on top of the MAL environment. It
has its own SQL-level specific settings.

**sql_debug**
   Enable debugging using a mask. This option should normally be
   disabled (0). Default: **0**.

**sql_optimizer**
   The default SQL optimizer pipeline can be set per server. See the
   optpipe setting in *monetdb*\ (1) when using monetdbd. During SQL
   initialization, the optimizer pipeline is checked against the
   dependency information maintained in the optimizer library to ensure
   there are no conflicts and at least the pre-requisite optimizers are
   used. The setting of sql_optimizer can be either the list of
   optimizers to run. Default: **default_pipe**.

   The following are possible pipes to use:

   **minimal_pipe**
      The minimal pipeline necessary by the server to operate correctly.
      minimal_pipe=inline,remap,deadcode,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,garbageCollector

   **default_pipe**
      The default pipeline contains the mitosis-mergetable-reorder
      optimizers, aimed at large tables and improved access locality.
      default_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,pushselect,aliases,mitosis,mergetable,deadcode,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,dataflow,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector

   **no_mitosis_pipe**
      The no_mitosis pipeline is identical to the default pipeline,
      except that optimizer mitosis is omitted. It is used mainly to
      make some tests work deterministically, and to check/debug whether
      "unexpected" problems are related to mitosis (and/or mergetable).
      no_mitosis_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,pushselect,aliases,mergetable,deadcode,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,dataflow,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector

   **sequential_pipe**
      The sequential pipeline is identical to the default pipeline,
      except that optimizers mitosis & dataflow are omitted. It is use
      mainly to make some tests work deterministically, i.e., avoid
      ambigious output, by avoiding parallelism.
      sequential_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,pushselect,aliases,mergetable,deadcode,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector

**embedded_py**
   Enable embedded Python. This means Python code can be called from
   SQL. The value is **true** or **3** for embedded Python 3. Note that
   by enabling embedded Python, users of the server are allowed to
   execute arbitrary Python code, and are therefore able to read and
   modify all data that the server process has access to.

**embedded_r=true**
   Enable embedded R. This means R code can be called from SQL. Note
   that by enabling embedded R, users of the server are allowed to
   execute arbitrary R code, and are therefore able to read and modify
   all data that the server process has access to.

**embedded_c=true**
   Enable embedded C. This means C code can be called from SQL. The C
   code will first be compiled and then executed. This means a C
   compiler must be available. Note also that by enabling embedded C,
   users of the server are allowed to execute arbitrary C code, and are
   therefore able to read and modify all data that the server process
   has access to. In addition, if the C code causes a crash, all bets
   are off.

**raw_strings=true**
   The boolean option raw_strings controls how the sql scanner
   interprets string literals. If the value is **false** then strings
   are interpreted as if they were delimited with E-quotes, that is
   strings are interpreted as C strings and backslash characters are
   needed to escape special characters. If the value is **true** then
   strings are interpreted as if they were delimited with R-quotes, that
   is all characters are interpreted literally. Single quote characters
   need to be doubled inside strings. The default value is **false**.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
==================

The configuration file readable by *mserver5* consists of parameters of
the form "*name*\ =\ *value*". The file is line-based, each
newline-terminated line represents either a comment or a parameter. Only
the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before
or after the first equals sign is not stripped. Trailing whitespace in a
parameter value is retained verbatim. Any line beginning with a hash
(**#**) is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace. The values
following the equals sign in parameters are all a string where quotes
are not needed, and if written be part of the string.
