# This ignore file purposely does not cater for building in situ.  We
# recommend that you build in a directory other than the source
# directory.

# You can add files to the ignore list by creating your private ignore
# file in your .hg directory.  Add these two lines to your .hg/hgrc
# file:
#	[ui]
#	ignore = <absolute path to .hg directory>/hgignore
# and create a file .hg/hgignore that contains your ignore patterns.

# This file contains patterns of files that get generated by the
# recommended build process plus a few patterns of files that we never
# want in the repository (object files and such).
