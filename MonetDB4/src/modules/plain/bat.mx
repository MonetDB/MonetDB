@* Binary Association Tables
@T
This module contains all commands that are of use when managing Binary
Association Tables (BATs). The relational operations you can execute
on BATs have the form of a @[<a href="../algebra/index.html">neat algebra</a>@.

But a database system needs more that just this algebra, since often it
is crucial to do table-updates (this would not be permitted in a strict
algebra).

All commands needed for BAT updates, property management, I/O, persistency, and storage options
can be found in this module.

@+ void bats
The append set of commands lets you append values (or bats) with unique 
head values which start at the maximum head value before inserting plus one.
The appended bats tail can not be set key-ed.

@- BAT properties
@T
Monet maintains a number of {\em properties} on each BAT that is used to steer tactical
query optimization (i.e. choosing a good algorithms for a particular algebra command).

These properties can be inspected with the {\tt info(BAT[any,any]) : BAT[str,str] } command:
\begin{verbatim}
> var car_age := bat(void,int);
> car_age.info().print();
#---------------------------------#
# BAT:		     tmp_31	  #
# (str)		     (str)	  #
#---------------------------------#
[ "batId",	     "car_age"	  ] # logical bat name
[ "batCacheid",	     "26"	  ] # BBP index
[ "batParentid",     "0"	  ] # set if a BAT is a view
[ "head",	     "void"	  ] # physical head-type
[ "tail",	     "int"	  ] # physical tail-type
[ "batPersistence",  "persistent" ] # transient/session/persistent
[ "batRestricted",   "updatable"  ] # read-only/append-only/updatable
[ "batDirty",	     "clean"	  ] # clean/dirty
[ "batRefcnt",	     "1"	  ] # physical refcount
[ "batLRefcnt",	     "1"	  ] # logical refcount (total)
[ "batPlevel",	     "1"	  ] # logical refcount (persistent part)
[ "batSet",	     "0"	  ] # [head,tail] combinations are unique
[ "batCopiedtodisk", "1"	  ] # has been saved or not
\end{verbatim}

The above are global BAT properties. The properties {\tt batPersistence},
{\tt batRestricted} and {\tt batDirty} will be explained in the next section,
and the various reference counts in the section that follows it.

Per column, a number of properties are kept. We only show the head-properties; the tail properties
have the first character of their named replaced by 't' ({\tt sorted}, {\tt tdense}, etc.):

\begin{verbatim}
[ "hsorted",	     "1"	  ] # column is known to be sorted
[ "hdense",	     "1"	  ] # column is known to be densely ascended
[ "hseqbase",	     "0@0"	  ] # if densely ascending (i.e. 0@0, 1@0, @,0, ...): first value
\end{verbatim}

As described in the @[<a href="../../gdk/index.html#mod_1_3_0">GDK Technical Reference</a>@,
BATs store their data in one to five heaps, of which at least one called {\tt batBuns}
is present always. For each column type that is {\em variable-sized} - like {\tt str} - another
heap might be present ({\tt hheap} and {\tt theap}). 

\begin{verbatim}
[ "batBuns.free",    "400004"	  ] # occupied size in bytes
[ "batBuns.size",    "400012"	  ] # allocated size in bytes
[ "batBuns.maxsize", "400012"	  ] # reserver virtual memory in bytes
[ "batBuns.storage", "malloced"	  ] # malloced/mmap/priv
\end{verbatim}

Properties steer the algorithms that Monet uses to execute algebra command. For instance,
the {\tt find(BAT[any::1,any::2] b, any:;1) : any::2) that looks up a tail value by head,
uses binary search if and only if the head column is sorted (in other cases, hash-lookup
and scan are execution options).

Sometimes new (extension) code contains bugs in the property management, leaving false
properties on produced BATs. You can imagine that later on, this leads to additional
bugs, as e,g, the binary search algorithms will yield erroneous results on a non-sorted
sequence.

To make problem detection easier, the MIL interpreter contains property checking code,
that is set with via the  {\tt debugmask(int)} command:
\begin{description}
\item[2] {\tt debugmask(debugmask() or 2)} makes that all properties on
newly created BATs are checked. You must realize that finding out that a column is sorted
({\tt hsorted/tsorted}) costs a full scan, and finding out that it contains unique values
({\tt hkeyed/tkeyed}) costs a full scan plus the creation of a full hash index.
\item[8] {\tt debugmask(debugmask() or 8)} makes that all properties on
{\bf all} BATs handled by the MIL interpreter are checked. This will catch all property errors.
\end{description}

By default, both bits in the {\tt debugmask} are off, which gives fastest performance.

@- BAT I/O, Persistency
@T
The BAT Buffer Pool (BBP) manages all known BATs. It administers
their logical and physical names and a reference count. BATs can
be {\em persistent}, {\em transient} or {\em session}. The BBP also manages
swapping on a BAT level: a BAT is either loaded entirely or not.
MIL variables of type {\tt bat} can either be loaded or not. When
the Monet server is started, all BATs are swapped out. If an unloaded
bat-variable is used as an operand in a command, it is automatically
loaded.	 The BBP applies a simple but effective LRU based swapping
algorithm. BATs have a {\em heat}, which drops over time, and is
increased when a BAT is used by some command.  If the size of the
allocated arena gets to be large, BATs may be swapped out.
@m

"Save a BAT to storage, if it was loaded and dirty. Returns whether IO was necessary.

.COMMAND unload(str name) : bit = CMDunload;
"Swapout a BAT to disk. Transient BATs can also be swapped out.

"Makes a BAT very hot for the BBP. The chance of being chosen for swapout is
 small, afterwards."

 big, afterwards."

.COMMAND heat(str nme) : int = CMDheat;
"returns the current BBP heat (LRU stamp)"


@- Heap Specific Commands
@T
BATs are stored in memory in a number of Heap objects. A heap is nothing
more than a contiguous range of memory. Bats are saved to disk by just writing
away their image. This approach without pointer swizzling makes it possible
to either load an image into an alloced range of memory (STORE\_MEM), or
memory-map (STORE\_MMAP) an image into virtual memory.

The heap images of a BAT are stored in the {\tt $MONETHOME/dbfarm/$DB/bat/}
directory.  For each bat X, the following heaps are stored:
\begin{description}
\item[X.buns] an array with all the fixed-size parts of all BUNs.
\item[X.hheap] if the head column contains a variable sized atoms (e.g. str),
then the fixed-size part of a BUN contains an integer byte-offset into
the heap. String values themselves are stored in this the X.hheap.
\item[X.theap] similar to X.hheap, but for the tail column.
\item[X.hacc]. On each column, you might create {\em persistent hash accelerator
structure}. 
\end{description}

Each of these heaps can be {\bf compressed} using the Unix {\tt compress}
utility forming a X.ext.Z file. Monet will automatically decompress it
upon load. Compressed heaps cannot be memory mapped.

A final file present for each t in the BAT directory is:
\begin{description}
\item[X.desc] the BAT descriptor. Stores most of the properties of a BAT.
\end{description}
@
For more technical information on BATs, we refer to the
@[<a href="../../gdk/index.html">GDK</a>@
documentation.
@m
.COMMAND mmap(BAT[any::1,any::2], int buns_mode, int hheap_mode, int theap_mode) : BAT[any::1,any::2] = CMDmmap;
"For each individual heap, you can change the allocation mode to
 either STORE_MEM or STORE_MMAP. Passing an int(nil) means: no change.
 Changing a dirty STORE_MEM heap into STORE_MMAP, will cause a BAT save
 (this has to happen before the heap can be mapped into virtual memory).
 These modes are persistent. "

.COMMAND madvise(BAT[any::1,any::2], int buns_mode, int hheap_mode, int theap_mode) : BAT[any::1,any::2] = CMDmadvise;
"Modern Operating Systems allow users to influence the buffer management
 policy of virtual memory. This is a crucial feature for database systems,
 and eliminates the need to reimplement the OS in a database buffer manager.
 The supported flags are BUF_NORMAL (the normal adaptive kernel algorithm),

 contain illegal nor duplicate page-ids in the tail (page-ids start at 0).

 If the last page of the input BAT is requested in the map, and the input bat is 
 not an exact multiple of 65536 (hence the last page is incomplete), the missing 
 tuples appear as NILs in the result.

 BAT is memory-mapped directly (not: privately mapped). In that case, you get

@m

 types index and hash will be created as transient accelerators. They
 will not be saved on disk. User-defined accelerators must always be
 persistent."
.COMMAND accdel(BAT[any,any] b, str acctype) = CMDaccdel;
"Delete an accelerator on the head column of b."

@- Synced BATs
The binary model of Monet has important advantages when working in
main-memory. Tables are thin and very efficiently processed. The binary
model gives rise, however, to a larger-than-normal number of join
and semijoin operations. Relations are split up in vertical parts that
are very much related to each other. Then, for instance, multiple
similar semijoins occur on different vertical parts. By equipping the
kernel with knowledge about the correspondence of these parts, we
can greatly limit the amount of work to be done.

When two BATs effectively contain the same sequence of head elements,
we call them 'synced'. This is implemented by storing a very large
OID for each column. An update to the column destroys this OID.
By comparing two OIDs the Monet kernel can very quickly decide that
two columns are exactly equal. All BAT algebra operations propagate
these 'sync' OIDs with their own propagation rules.

@+ Page-wise BAT remappings
@T
The XML node storage scheme of MonetDB/XQuery needs some extra kernel support. 

\begin{itemize}
\item
  we introduce a fast way to create BATs with the VM pages in a different order
  (to cheaply support inserting new pages halfway). 
\item
  for other bats, there is a new rcopy(), that copies large heaps using
  copy-on-write memory maps. This is also done for string heaps, if they are
  no longer double eliminated. 
\item
  we introduce a primitive to swizzle OIDs for such remappings between RIDs (the real
  voids on disk) and PREs (the voids of the remapped copy).
\item
  we introduce 'isolate()' a primitive that executes a number of idempotent updates
  on a bat, such that all modified logical pages have received physical page
  copies (transparently by the MMU page faults it generates).
\end{itemize}

Also, we use copy-on-write maps for transaction isolation. Contrary to intuition, we 
write into STORE_MMAP read-only master bats (overriding the read-only protection 
with a new 'force' flag), and read only from the copy-on-write copies produced by 
the 'remap' and 'rcopy'. These copies provide efficient shadow paging. That is, before a master bat 
is replaced into (appends are no problem) then all live read copies (copy-on-write remaps) 
get a 'idempotent' replace on the affected pages (a BUN replace with a value that was 
already there), such that a shadow copy of the page is made by the OS. In this way, 
the subsequent update in the master bat is invisible in the copy-on-write copies 
(transaction isolation). 

The shadow copying could be done with BUN-replaces but can be optimized to touch just
one word per physical page. This is done by CMDisolate.

Similarly, the swizzle computations (from physical to logical id in remapped bats)
could be done with shifts, mask, addition and fetchjoins; it is done much faster
using the special-purpose CMDswizzle.  

other changes were:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  gdk_bat.mx/gdk_batop.mx: a 'force' flag in update operations that allow to update
  read-only/append-only BATs anyway. Note that if used, another (WAL-based) recovery
  mechanism must be used to repair BATs after a system crash!! This is a user
  respsonability (in this case, of the MonetDB/XQuery frontend).
\item
  gdk_bat.mx: make a true copy of remapped/rcopied BUN heaps if the bat becomes persistent 
  or updatable. 
\item
  gdk_batop.mx: optimized fetchjoin for idempotent positional joins (into a bat[void,void]
  with equal seqbase and all tuples hitting). To keep semantics consistent, it is now
  an error if a fetchjoin is performed with a key that is out-of-range. Everything *must* match!
\item
  gdk_storage.mx: batload.  To preserve the integritry of string heaps with such forced updates, 
  the kernel zaps the internal hash table of string heaps. Note that this is only allowed if 
  double-elimination inside the string heap is disabled (in that case the hash table is not 
  required to be complete).  To prevent problems, the rcopy() does not do mmap-tricks for 
  double-eliminating heaps.
\end{itemize}

In swizzling as well as in positional join, specific optimizations are made for
the common case where all pages appear in order (this occurs in XML tables that have
not yet received updates or are read-only). In this case swizzling is a no-op.

For read-only tables, logical node IDs (nids) are equal to both PREs and RIDs. A 
translation from NID to PRE (or RID) then becomes positional join onto a bat[void,void] 
with seqbases 0@0, which is an idempotent join. This case now returns a view at
zero cost.

@- Remapped Copy
@T
CMDremap makes a copy of a bat, putting the logical 'pages' (REMAP_PAGE_SIZE tuples) in an 
alternative order, specified by a map. It is optimized to use copy-on-write memory 
mappings to make cheap copies, when possible.

The result is a read-only copy of the original. As it is a true copy, in principle 
we can replace (but nor insert/delete) BUNs in it, overriding the access restriction.

Making such bats persistent or appendable/writable, will force a true copy of the 
copy-on-write mmap heap to be made.

@- fast isolation support

If *pageids == TRUE, the oids are logical page-ids (REMAP_PAGE_SIZE) and the entire page
needs to be isolated. Note the distinction between physical and logical pages. VM needs
isolation on the physical level. The difference can be significant. A locical page is defined 
as a number of tuples (e.g. 64K) thus spans up to 512KB in case of a 8-byte type such as lng 
or oid. Such a a 512KB range may span up to 128 physical OS pages (MT_pagesize can be as low 
as 4KB on current systems).

All this is taken csre of by CMDisolate.
