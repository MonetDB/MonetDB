@* The squeezer
This module contains the framework for inclusion of squeezer code, i.e.
C-programs geared at optimizing a piece of MAL.
The squeezer appears at the language level as an ordinary module.
Each squeezer function has access to the runtime scope of the
routine in which it is called. This can be used to maintain status
information between successive calls. For example, constant propagation
within a block should be done once. This can be realized by either
dropping the call squeezer.constantpropagation() from the optimized
code or to maintain a runtime boolean checked upon calling this
squeezer.

The commands below are primarilly designed for testing the squeezer
infrastructure. They will disappear when the functionality is fixed.
@mal
# The routines below are linked with the kernel by default

MODULE squeezer;
PATTERN prepare():int = sqzPrepare;
PATTERN access(nme:str):int = sqzAccess;
COMMAND AccessTst(i:int):int = sqzAccessTst;
PATTERN propagateConstants():int = sqzPropagateConstants;
