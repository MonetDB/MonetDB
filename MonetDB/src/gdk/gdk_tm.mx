@* Transaction management
The Transaction Manager maintains the buffer of (permanent) BATS held resident.
Entries from the BAT buffer are always accessed by BAT id.
A BAT becomes permanent by assigning a name with @%BATrename@.
Access to the transaction table is regulated by a semaphore.

@- 
The physical (disk) commit protocol is handled mostly by BBPsync. Once a commit
succeeded, there is the task of removing ex-persistent bats (those that still
were persistent in the previous commit, but were made transient in this transaction).
Notice that such ex- (i.e. non-) persistent bats are not backed up by the BBPsync
protocol, so we cannot start deleting after we know the commit will succeed.

Another hairy issue are the delta statuses in BATs. These provide a fast way
to perform a transaction abort (HOT-abort, instead of COLD-abort, which is achieved
by the BBP recovery in a database restart). Hot-abort functionality has not been 
important in MonetDB for now, so it is not well-tested. The problem here is that 
if a commit fails in the physical part (BBPsync), we have not sufficient information 
to roll back the delta statuses. 

So a 'feature' of the abort is that after a failed commit, in-memory we
*will* commit the transaction. Subsequent commits can retry to achieve a physical
commit. The only way to abort in such a situation is COLD-abort: quit the server and 
restart, so you get the recovered disk images.

Transaction abort is cheap. We use the delta statuses
to go back to the previous version of each BAT. Also
for BATs that are currently swapped out. Persistent BATs 
that were made transient in this transaction become
persistent again.

@- TMsubcommit

Routine to quickly add new bats or remove old bats in a commited database state.
Both cases have in common that rollback actions are not necessary. This
allows for an implementation that comes down to just writing a new BBP.dir.

We assume that the thread calling this has exclusive write access to the 
bats it wants to commit (passed in the tail of bl).
In particular, if another thread updates one of the bats passed here during
the partial commit (or modifies its persistency status), inconsistent results
may occur.

Note that this primitive also assumes that the BATs being commited are independent
of the other persistent BATs. That is, no incosistent state is created by commiting 
the actual state of this subset of BAT and not committing the rest.

TMsubcommit(BAT* bl) {
	int xx, cnt = 0, *changed = (int*) alloca(BATcount(bl)*sizeof(int));
	BUN p, q;
