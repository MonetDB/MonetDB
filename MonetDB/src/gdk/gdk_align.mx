@* BAT Alignment 
For BATs that result from a n-ary relational scheme it may help to
align the BATs on their head value. In particular, it permits
replacing a hash-join by a merge-join, which is significantly faster
on large tables. Especially if the BATs involved cause page activity
or when you can not afford the large hash structures to speed-up processing.
@-
For orthogonality, we support alignment between arbitrary columns (head or tail).
@-
All standard GDK set-calls update the alignment info in their respective 
ways. For example, the routine @emph{BUNclustercopy} shuffles the first argument, 
such that the BUNs are in the same order as those in the second argument. 
This operation will mark both columns of the first @emph{BAT} as synced with
the second (likewise, @emph{BATcopy()}, which makes a copy, instead of in-place 
shuffling, has the same alignment effect, @emph{BATmark()} marks the tail column 
as synced with the head of the original @emph{BAT}, and for instance 
@emph{BATsemijoin()} marks both return columns as aligned with its left parameter).
@
Each alignment sequence is given a unique identifier, so as to easily
detect this situation. It is retained in the @emph{BAT descriptor}.
@+ Alignment Design Considerations
Alignment primitives require the right hooks to be inserted in 
several places in the GDK, apart form this file:
@itemize
@item @emph{ BUN update operations}. 
The updated BATs have to be marked as 
un-aligned.
@item @emph{ set operations}. 
For most relational operations some
statements can be made about the size and order of the BATs 
they produce. This information can be formalized by indicating alignment
information automatically.
@item @emph{ transaction operations}. 
Alignment statuses must be 
kept consistent under database commits and aborts.
@end itemize
@
As for performance, the most important observation to make is that 
operations that do not need alignment, will suffer most from
overheads introduced in the BUN update mechanism. For this reason,
the alignment-delete operation has to be very cheap. It is
captured by the @emph{ALIGNdel} macro, and just zaps one character
field in the @emph{BAT} record.
@
@{
@+ Alignment Implementation
The @emph{BAT} record is equipped with an @emph{batAlign} field that keeps
both information about the head and tail column. The leftmost
4 bits are for the head, the rightmost 4 for the tail. This
has been done to make the zap ultra-cheap.

Both head and tail column contain an OID in the @emph{halign} and @emph{talign}
fields respectively to mark their alignment group. All BATs with the
same OID in this field (and the ALIGN_SYNCED bit on) are guaranteed
by the system to have equal head columns. As an exception, they
might also have TYPE_void head columns (a virtual column). 
In such a case, the tail values correspond to the head values
that would have been there in a non-virtual column, continuing
the same head-sequence as the other BATs in the sync group.

@+ View BATS
The general routine for getting a 'view' BAT upon another 
BAT is @emph{VIEWcreate}. On this @emph{#read-only} BAT (there is kernel
support for this), you can then make vertical slices. 
Use @emph{VIEWhead} for this. 
@
It is possible to create a view on a writable BAT. Updates
in the parent are then automatically reflected in the VIEW.
Note that the VIEW bat itself can never be modified.
@
Horizontal views should only be given out on a view BAT, but
only if it is dead sure the parent BAT is read-only.
This because they cannot physically share the batBuns heap
with the parent, as they need a modified version.
