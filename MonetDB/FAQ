FAQ for MonetDB and its SQL server front end
============================================

1) Why does Mserver complain about a missing initialization script?
2) How do I start an SQL console?
3) How do I run a SQL batch program?
4) How do I run a Perl (Python, C, Java, ...) application?
5) Which application programming interfaces exist?

========================================================================

1) Why does Mserver complain about a missing initialization script?

Running a server in daemon mode requires initialization of the server
context. The actions are read from a file passed as the last argument
on the command string. An example of such a script would be:

print("welcome to the world of MonetDB");
module(sql_server);
print("server is ready to accept SQL sessions");

========================================================================

2) How do I start an SQL console?

In release 4.4 the SQL compiler is a separate module in the
sourceforge repository. It should be checked out in much the same way
as MonetDB itself (change 'MonetDB' into 'sql'). In the root directory
of the sql distribution you find the HowtoStart-SQL document, which
contains step-by-step instructions.

========================================================================

3) How do I run a SQL batch program?

Make sure that you have MonetDB's SQL frontend installed and the
sql_server module loaded in your running Mserver.  Collect the SQL
statements in a file. Then simply type:

MapiClient -lsql < batchfile

========================================================================

4) How do I run a Perl (Python, C, Java, ...) application?

The MonetDB source tree contains a section Mapi/clients, where you
also find sample applications to interact with the server. For most
APIs we have included a simple textual monitor to show the basic
interaction, called MapiClient. Try this one first before developing
your own applications.

5) Which application programming interfaces exist?


MonetDB contains low-level TCP-IP libraries to setup a communication
channel from programs written in C, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Haskell,
Tcl.

A beta implementation of ODBC is also available in pre-release. This
API is being worked on now. The current status is that only an
elementary subset of the API is implemented, and its functionality is
not yet fully tested.

The most extensive library for interaction is Mapi, which provides a
cached tabular abstraction for queries. It comes in a C and Java
version. A synopsis of the interface is given below:

mapi_bind()
	Bind string C-variable to field

mapi_bind_var()
	Bind typed C-variable to field

mapi_bind_numeric()
	Bind numeric C-variable to field

mapi_cache_limit()
	Set the tuple cache limit

mapi_connect()
	Connect to a Mserver

mapi_connect_ssl()
	Connect to a Mserver using SSL

mapi_disconnect()
	Disconnect from server

mapi_dup()
	Duplicate the connection structure

mapi_error()
	Test for error occurrence

mapi_explain()
	Display error message and context on stream

mapi_execute()

mapi_get_host()
	Host name of server

mapi_get_language()
	Query language name

mapi_get_version()
	Monet version identifier

mapi_get_user()
	Current user name

mapi_get_field_count()
	Number of fields in current row

mapi_get_row_count()
	Number of rows in cache or -1

	Escape characters

mapi_rows_affected()
	Obtain number of rows changed

mapi_quick_response()
	Quick pass response to stream

mapi_seek_row()
