monetdb (1.38.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
    This is mainy for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can now be
    built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".
    Files that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
    "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on Windows,
    requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
    getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably) requiring a
    rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

monetdb (1.38.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented build directory support for Windows,
    i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
    build directory as alternative to ...<package>NT, and thus keep the
    latter clean from files generated during the build.
    On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...<package>NT .

    (SF bug 2947763.)

monetdb (1.36.5-20100420) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a potential file leak: under certain conditions, files in the
    database might not get deleted when they should (they would be
    deleted when the server restarts).

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various concurrency bugs were fixed.
  * Various changes were made to run better on systems that don't have enough
    memory to keep everything in core that was touched during query processing.
    This is done by having the higher layers giving hints to the database
    kernel about future use, and the database kernel giving hings to the
    operating system kernel about how (virtual) memory is going to be used.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in mergejoin implementation.
    This fixes bug  #2952191.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for compiling on Windows using the Cygwin-provided
    version of flex.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix compilation issue when configured with --with-curl.
    This fixes bug #2924999.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added implementation of MT_getrss() for Solaris.  This yields in the
    kernel knowing about its (approximate) memory usage to try and help
    the operating system to free that memory that is best to free, instead
    of a random page, e.g. the work of the vmtrim thread.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented a "fast" string BAT append:
    Under certain conditions, instead of inserting values one-by-one,
    we now concatenate the string heap wholesale and just manipulate
    the offsets.
    This works both for BATins and BATappend.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the string heap implementation to also contain the hashes of
    strings.
  * Changed the implementation of the string offset columns to be
    dynamically sized.
