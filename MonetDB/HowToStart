0) Preliminaries
================

Compiling Monet from its sources now involves three major directory
structures:

	BASE	where the common source base has been checked out from the
		cvs repository.

	BUILD	where "configure" puts the architecture-specific source tree
		that it generates from the common source base in BASE. 
		here, also the compilation takes place.

	PREFIX	where "make install" finally puts the binaries, libraries,
		include files, etc.

in principle, BASE, BUILD, and PREFIX might be identical, but in many cases,
it's convenient if they make-up separate directory trees. Then, one can
easily "rm -rf" BUILD, in order to rebuild the whole stuff from scratch, or
"rm -rf" BASE and BUILD, once everything is compiled an properly installed
in PREFIX.

In the remainder, we will just refer to BASE, BUILD, and PREFIX. You can
(have to ;-) decide for yourself, whether they should be all identical, all
different, or maybe BASE == BUILD != PREFIX, or BASE != BUILD == PREFIX. In
any case, BASE, BUILD, & PREFIX should always be given as absolute paths.


1) Preparing your environment
=============================

The Monet development system needs two environment variables BUILD and PREFIX 
to work properly. They are set to convenient defaults upon first use:

	BUILD=BASE/`uname`
	PREFIX=BUILD

You can overrule this default by selecting your desired build and target
directory and setting the variables in your shell before continuing.

Likewise, the Monet development system needs the identity of the desired
compiler ("GNU" or "ntv" (native)), the desired binary type (32bit or
64bit), and whether binarys should be linked dynamically or statically. 
You can do this by setting the following environment variables:

	COMP="GNU"	or	COMP="ntv"
	BITS="32"	or	BITS="64"
	LINK="dynamic"	or	LINK="static"

If not or wrongly set,  COMP=GNU BITS=32 LINK=dynamic  are used as default.

After that, you need to set your (architecture dependent) environment to be
able to compile Monet-4.2. The easiest way to do so, is to

	source  conf/conf.bash	(for [ba]sh users)
or
	source  conf/conf.csh	(for [t]csh users)

in BASE. These scripts look for the preset environment variables to adopt to
you preferences.

Depending on the architecture your currently working on, and depending on
your settings for COMP, BITS, LINK, BUILD, and PREFIX, conf/conf.{ba,c}sh
setup the environment as needed by configure. Among others, these script
take care of
 - setting the proper PATH & LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
 - choosing the proper C/C++ compiler calls (i.e., setting command name and
   flags in CC & CXX).
For details, have a look at the scripts; they're not too weird ... ;-)
Finally, these scripts tell you how to go on, and which flags to use with
configure.


2) Bootstrap & Configure
========================

Once you setup your environment properly (see above), you need to execute
the following in BASE:

	./bootstrap
	cd ${BUILD}
	${BASE}/configure --prefix=${PREFIX}

Unless you (or a cvs update) modify any "Makefile.ag"-file, or delete any of
the files created by bootstrap or configure, you need to execute them only
once after a cvs checkout. 

NOTE: Never edit any of the files created by bootstrap or configure. Here,
it becomes most convenient, if you use BASE != BUILD: configure puts all its
output to BUILD and keep BASE "clean"; bootstrap create its output in BASE,
but actually only "Makefile.{am,msc,in}"-file. So, never touch any on these,
and never touch anything in BUILD. If you need some changes to one those
files, you must look for its origin in BASE (i.e., checked out from the cvs
tree) and modify this. Unless it is a "Makefile.ag"-file, you do not even have
to re-run bootstrap or configure. Configure takes care of the dependencies
between the original source file (and the bootstrap output) in BASE and the
configure output in BUILD. You only have to edit (your) original source file
in BASE and the call "make" in BUILD (see below).


2) Make & Make Install
======================

Once bootstrap-ed and configure-d, you can compile Monet,by simply calling

	make

in BUILD. This compiles everything in about 10 minutes (on 550Mhz Linux box),
and leaves the results in BUILD.

To finally move the results to your favorite destination (i.e., PREFIX),
just call

	make install

in BUILD. Of course, this only works properly when make was successful...
Well, a simple "make install" without a "make" before should also work; make
install also checks the dependencies back to the original sources, and just
do a make first, if necessary.

As already mentioned above, during "normal development", you will just edit
(your) sources in BASE and then call make / make install in BUILD. Very
convenient ...

Have fun with Monet!
