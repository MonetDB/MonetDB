How To Start with MonetDB
=========================

.. This document is written in reStructuredText (see
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for more information).

This document helps you compile and install the MonetDB source.  Once
this is done, refer to doc/MonetDB.html for the user documentation
generated as part of the process.

In case you prefer installing a pre-compiled binary distribution,
please check-out `the SourceForge documentation`__.

__ http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967

This document assumes that you are planning on compiling and
installing MonetDB on a Unix system (e.g., Linux, IRIX, Solaris, AIX,
MacOS X/Darwin, or CYGWIN).

For compilation and installation on a native Windows system (NT, 2000, XP)
see the instructions in the file `HowToStart-Win32.txt`__.

__ Windows/index.html

Prerequisites
-------------

CVS
	You need to have a working CVS.  For instructions, see `the
	SourceForge documentation`__ and look under the heading CVS
	Instructions.

__ http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1

Python
	MonetDB uses Python (version 2.0.0 or better) during
	configuration of the software.  See http://www.python.org/ for
	more information.

autoconf/automake/libtool
	MonetDB uses GNU autoconf (>= 2.53), automake (>= 1.5), and
	libtool (>= 1.4) during configuration of the software.  See
	http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/,
	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/, and
	http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ for more information.
	Libtool is also used during the build.

standard software development tools
	To compile MonetDB, you also need to have the following
	standard software development tools installed and ready for
	use on you system:

	- a C/C++ compiler (e.g., GNU's gcc/g++)
	- a lexical analyzer generator (e.g., ``lex`` or ``flex``)
	- a parser generator (e.g., ``yacc`` or ``bison``)
	- GNU make (``gmake``) (native make on, e.g., IRIX and Solaris
	  usually don't work)

Mx, mel, and autogen
	Before building MonetDB, you first need to build and install
	the MonetDB buildtools.  Check out buildtools with
	::

	 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb checkout buildtools

	and follow the instructions in the README file, then proceed
	with MonetDB.

dlcompat (MacOS X/Darwin, only)
	MacOS X/Darwin itself does not support dlopen, however, there
	is a third-party library called dlcompat from Fink that
	provides the respective functionality.  MonetDB requires
	dlcompat__ to be installed on MacOS X/Darwin.

disk space
	After downloading, MonetDB takes up about 40 MB of disk space;
	compilation adds another 70 MB.  Testing takes about 45 MB,
	and the installation about 20 MB (not including any
	databases).

Getting the Software
--------------------

There are two ways to get the source code:

(1) checking it out from the CVS repository on SourceForge;
(2) downloading the pre-packaged source distribution form
    SourceForge__.

__ http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967 .

The following instructions first describe how to check out the source
code from the CVS repository on SourceForge; in case you downloaded
the pre-packaged source distribution, you can skip this section and
proceed to `Bootstrap, Configure and Make`_.

CVS checkout
````````````

This command should be done once.  It records a password on the local
machine to be used for all subsequent CVS accesses with this server.

::

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb login

Just type RETURN when asked for the password.

Then get the software by using the command::

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb checkout buildtools MonetDB

This will create a directories buildtools and MonetDB in your current
working directory.  Then first follow the instructions in
buildtools/README before continuing with MonetDB.

Also see `the SourceForge documentation`__ for more
information about using CVS.

__ http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=56967

Bootstrap, Configure and Make
-----------------------------

Before executing the following steps, make sure that your
shell-environment (especially variables like ``PATH`` and
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``) is set up, thus that the tools listed above can be
found.  (Bash users at CWI and DD can simply ``source
conf/conf.bash``.  This sets the proper environment and even provides
aliases ``configure_MonetDB`` and ``Mtest_MonetDB`` for convenience.
See conf/conf.bash itself for more details.)

In case you checked out the CVS version, you have to run
``bootstrap``, first; in case you downloaded the pre-packaged source
distribution, you should skip ``bootstrap`` and start with
``configure`` (see next step).  In the top-level directory of MonetDB
type the command (note that this uses autogen.py which is part of the
buildtools package--make sure it can be found in your ``$PATH``)::

 ./bootstrap

Then in any directory (preferably a *new, empty* directory and *not*
in the MonetDB top-level directory) give the command::

 .../configure [<options>]

where ``...`` is replaced with the (absolute or relative) path to the
MonetDB top-level directory.
The directory where you execute configure is the place where all
intermediate source and object files are generated during compilation
via ``make``.

By default, MonetDB is installed to ``/usr/local``.  To choose another
target directory, you need to call

::

 .../configure --prefix=<prefixdir> [<options>]

Some other useful configure options are:

--enable-debug          enable full debugging default=off
--enable-optimize       enable extra optimization default=off
--enable-warning        enable extended compiler warnings default=off
--enable-profile        enable profiling default=off
--enable-instrument     enable instrument default=off
--with-gcc=<compiler>   which C compiler to use
                        (``yes`` = gcc/g++, 
                        ``no`` = system-specific C/C++ compiler,
                        <other-compiler-name>)
--with-gxx=<compiler>   which C++ compiler to use
--with-mx=<Mx>          which Mx binary to use (default: whichever
                        Mx is found in your PATH)
--with-mel=<mel>        which mel binary to use (default: whichever
                        mel is found in your PATH)
--enable-bits=<#bits>   specify number of bits (32 or 64)

Use the ``--help`` option of configure to find out more about
configure options.

In the same directory (where you called configure) give the command

::

 make

to compile the source code.

On my lightly loaded, dual 1.4 GHz Athlon Linux system, configure
takes about 30 seconds, and make about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on
the optimization level chosen during configure.


Testing the Build
-----------------

If make went successfully, you can try

::

 make check

This will perform a large number of tests, some are unfortunately
still expected to fail, but most should go successfully.  At the end
of the output there is a reference to an HTML file which is created by
the test process that shows the test results.  An explanation of the
test results can be found in XXX--to be filled in.

Testing takes about 46 MB of disk space in the build directory.

Running the tests takes about 13 minutes on my system.


Installing
----------

Give the command

::

 make install

By default (if no --prefix option was given to configure above), this
will install in /usr/local/.  Make sure you have appropriate
privileges.


Testing the Installation
------------------------

Make sure that ``/usr/local/bin`` (respectively ``<prefixdir>/bin``,
where <prefixdir> is the directory you specified with ``--prefix``
when calling ``configure``) is in your ``PATH``.

In the MonetDB top-level directory issue the command

::

 Mtest.py -r

This should produce much the same output as make check above, but uses
the installed version of MonetDB.

You need write permissions in part of the installation directory for
this command: it will create subdirectories var/dbfarm and Tests.


Usage
-----

There are two alternatives for using MonetDB interactively.  In both
cases you first need to make sure that your environment is set as
described in `Bootstrap, Configure and Make`_ and `Testing the
Installation`_ above.

If you are "in a hurry", you can then simply start

::

 Mserver

and you'll get the "server console", where you can type your MIL
commands.  The server console is mainly meant for administrative use,
hence there are no conveniences such as commandline editing or command
history.

For a more convenient MIL interface, you should use the ``MapiClient`` with
the Mserver. To do so, first start an Mserver with MAPI (MonetDB Application
Programmer's Interfaces) support as follows::

 Mserver --dbinit="module(mapi); mapi_start();"

Then, in a second shell, set up the same environment and start the
MapiClient::

 MapiClient

With MapiClient, you get a text-based MIL interface that supports
commandline editing and a commandline history. The latter can even be
stored persistently to be re-used after stopping and restarting
MapiClient; see

::

 MapiClient --help

for details.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation starts in <prefixdir>/doc/MonetDB.html

NOTE: the current ``make install`` does not yet generate this
documentation to do this manually, execute *after* successful ``make
install``.  In the top-level directory of the MonetDB build tree, call

::

 make docs


Troubleshooting
---------------

Bootstrap fails if any of the requisite programs can not be found or
is an incompatible version.

Bootstrap adds files to the source directory, so it must have write
permissions.

During bootstrap, warnings like

::

	Remember to add `AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
	You should add the contents of `/usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4' to `aclocal.m4'.
	configure.in:37: warning: do not use m4_patsubst: use patsubst or m4_bpatsubst
	configure.in:104: warning: AC_PROG_LEX invoked multiple times
	configure.in:334: warning: do not use m4_regexp: use regexp or m4_bregexp
	automake/aclocal 1.6.3 is older than 1.7.
	Patching aclocal.m4 for Intel compiler on Linux (icc/ecc).
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 2542.
	1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej
	patching file aclocal.m4
	Hunk #1 FAILED at 1184.
	Hunk #2 FAILED at 2444.
	Hunk #3 FAILED at 2464.
	3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file aclocal.m4.rej

might occur.
For some technical reasons, it's hard to completely avoid
them. However, it is usually save to ignore them and simply proceed
with the usual compilation procedure. Only in case the subsequent
configure or make do fail, these warning might have to be take more
serious; in any case, you should include the bootstrap output in
whenever you report (see below) compilation problems.

Configure will fail if certain essential programs can't be found or
certain essential tasks (such as compiling a C program) can't be
executed.  The problem will usually be clear from the error message.

E.g., if configure cannot find package XYZ, it is either not installed
on your machine, or it is not installed in places that configure
usually searches (i.e., /usr, /usr/local).  In the first case, you
need to install package XYZ before you can configure, make, and
install MonetDB.  In the latter case, you need to tell configure via
``--with-XYZ=<DIR>`` where to find packages XYZ on your
machine. configure then looks for the respective header files in
<DIR>/include, and for the respective libraries in <DIR>/lib.

In case either of ``bootstrap``, ``configure``, or ``make`` fails ---
especially after a ``cvs update``, or after you changed some code
yourself --- please try the following steps (in that order; if you are
using the pre-packaged source distribution, you have to skip steps 2
and 3):

(In case you experience problems after a ``cvs update``, first make sure
that you used ``cvs update -dP`` (or have a line ``update -dP`` in
your ~/.cvsrc); ``-d`` ensures, that cvs checks out directories that
have been added since your last ``cvs update``; ``-P`` removed
directories that have become empty, because all their file have been
removed from the cvs repository. In case you did not use ``cvs update
-dP``, re-run ``cvs update -dP``, and remember to always use ``cvs update
-dP`` from now on (or simply add a line ``update -dP`` to your
~/.cvsrc)!)

0) In case only ``make`` fails, you can try running::

	make clean

   in your build directory and proceed with step 5; however, if ``make``
   then still fails, you have to re-start with step 1.
1) Clean up your whole build directory (i.e., the one where you ran
   ``configure`` and ``make``) by going there and running::

	make maintainer-clean

   In case your build directory is different from your source
   directory, you are advised to remove the whole build directory.
2) Go to the top-level source directory and run::

	./de-bootstrap

   This will remove all the files that were created during
   ``bootstrap``.
3) In the top-level source directory, re-run::

	./bootstrap

4) In the build-directory, re-run::

	configure

   as described above.
5) In the build-directory, re-run::

	make
	make install

   as described above.

If this still does not help, please contact us.
