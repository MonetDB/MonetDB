* Fri May  3 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- ICONV support has been removed from the stream library.  The server
  itself only needs UTF-8 support.  The client (mclient) does have
  iconv support.

* Wed Feb 21 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- CURL support has been removed from the stream library.  If support is
  needed, look at the source code in either streamcat.c or mclient.c.

* Wed Sep 19 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- The functions mnstr_write{Sht,Int,Lng,Hge} and their Array variants
  now swap bytes of the written values if the stream is set to swap bytes
  (i.e. big-endian on a little-endian machine and v.v.).
- Removed defines ST_ASCII, ST_BIN, ST_READ, ST_WRITE from stream.h.
- Changed function mnstr_set_byteorder(stream, char) to
  mnstr_set_bigendian(stream, bool) where the second argument should
  be `true' for specifying that the stream is bigendian.  This sets an
  internal flag whether or not to swap bytes which can be retrieved
  with mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream).
- Changed function `int mnstr_byteorder(stream)' to `bool
  mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream)'; it now returns whether bytes are
  swapped.
- Changed function `int mnstr_type(stream)' to `bool
  mnstr_isbinary(stream)'.

* Tue Feb 13 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- Added support for lz4 compressed files in the stream library

* Tue Nov 21 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- The interface of mnstr_fgetpos and mnstr_fsetpos was changed to look
  more like the standard C functions fsetpos and fgetpos: they both have
  a second argument "pointer to fpos_t".

* Tue Aug  8 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Removed function wbstream.

* Mon Aug  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Removed functions udp_rastream and udp_wastream.
- Removed functions socket_rstream and socket_wstream.
- Removed functions append_wstream and append_wastream.
- Removed functions mnstr_rstream and mnstr_wstream.

* Fri Mar 28 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.1-20141024
- Changed mnstr_settimeout function so that the specified timeout is now
  in milliseconds (used to be seconds), and that it also needs an extra
  argument specifying a callback function (no arguments, int result)
  that should return TRUE if the timeout should cause the function to
  abort or continue what it was doing.
