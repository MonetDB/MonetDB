/* streams working on a lzma/xz-compressed disk file */

#include "monetdb_config.h"

/* The logic of zlib's inflate and various other compression libraries
 * is always very similar. At the heart there is a work function which is
 * called with an input buffer, an output buffer and some internal state.
 * The function tries to move bits out of the input buffer through the
 * internal state to the output buffer until the input buffer is empty
 * or the output buffer is full.
 *
 * It has an action parameter which controls flushing: sometimes, for example
 * when closing the file, you want to flush the internal state out instead
 * of hanging onto it waiting for more compression opportunities. If that
 * parameter is set, the protocol is that you keep making room in the output
 * buffer and keep offering *exactly the same* input buffer until the
 * worker indicates all content has been flushed.
 *
 * All compression libraries we use have such an API but of course the
 * parameter types etc are always different.
