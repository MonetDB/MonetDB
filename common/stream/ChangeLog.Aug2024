# ChangeLog file for stream
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri May  3 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- ICONV support has been removed from the stream library.  The server
  itself only needs UTF-8 support.  The client (mclient) does have
  iconv support.

* Wed Feb 21 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- CURL support has been removed from the stream library.  If support is
  needed, look at the source code in either streamcat.c or mclient.c.
