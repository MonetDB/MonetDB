.TH MSERVER5 1 "APR 2011" MonetDB "MonetDB 5"
.SH NAME
mserver5 \- the MonetDB server version 5
.SH DESCRIPTION
mserver5 is the current MonetDB server that that performs all processing
on request of clients for a certain database.
.P
Note that while mserver5 is the process that does the actual work, it
is usually more common to start, monitor and connect to the mserver5
process through
.BR monetdbd (1) .
.P
This man-page describes the options that mserver5 understands.  It is
intended for people who really need to work with mserver5 itself.  In
regular cases, the programs
.BR monetdbd "(1) and " monetdb (1)
control the many options, and allow to adjust them to appropriate values
where sensible.  For normal usage, it is preferred to apply any
configuration through these programs.
.SH "OPERATION"
When the build-time configuration did not disable this, a mserver5
process presents the user with a console prompt.  On this prompt, MAL
commands can be executed.
The architecture is setup to handle multiple streams of requests.
The first thread started represents the server, which is the console
prompt, reading from standard input and writing to standard output.
.P
The server thread started remains in existence until all other threads die.
The server is stopped by Ctrl-D on its console, typing quit() or by
sending it a termination signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT).

.SH "MSERVER5 OPTIONS"
mserver5 can be started with options and scripts as arguments.  The
MAL scripts will be executed directly after startup on the console,
which eases e.g. testing of MAL scripts directly, without starting a
client.
.P 
.IP "--dbfarm=<path>"
Path where mserver5 should find a database.  Shorthand for option
gdk_dbfarm.  Default value:
@localstatedir@/monetdb5/dbfarm.
.IP "--dbname=<name>"
Database name to start, within the dbfarm.  Shorthand for option
gdk_dbname.  Default value: demo.
.IP "--dbinit=<stmt>"
MAL statement to execute as part of the startup of the server.
.IP "--config=<file>"
Config file to read options from.  This file can contain all options as
can be set with the --set flag.  See
.IR "CONFIG FILE FORMAT" .
.IP "--daemon=<yes|no>"
Disable the console prompt, do not read commands from standard input.
Default: no
.IP "--set <option>=<value>"
Set individual configuration option.  For possible options, see
.IR PARAMETERS sections.
.IP "--help"
Print list of options.
.IP "--version"
Print version and compile configuration.

.SH "GDK PARAMETERS"
GDK (Goblin Database Kernel) is the current columnar storage kernel
engine of the MonetDB 5 database.  It is the component that manages and
performs operations on BATs (Binary Association Tables), single columns.
The parameters here affect the behaviour of GDK which may nagatively
impact performance if set wrongly.  The kernel tries to choose the
values for optimal performance.  Changing these parameters is
discouraged.
.P 
.IP "gdk_mem_bigsize"
Memory chunks of size >= gdk_mem_bigsize (in bytes) will be mmaped
anonymously.  Default: 1<<20 == 1024576 == 1 MiB
.\" for 32 bit systems try to claim 3G of (virtual) memory; ???
.IP "gdk_vmtrim"
Enable or disable the vmtrim thread which tries to unload memory that is
not in use.  Default: yes
.IP "gdk_alloc_map"
This parameter is mainly for debugging with valgrind.
.\" For 32-bit systems, GDK tries claim 3G of (virtual) memory.
.\" set the alloc map to "no" to run mserver with valgrind;
Also, you need to tell valgrind to use 8-byte alignment, hence:
\(dq\&valgrind --alignment=8 mserver5 --set gdk_alloc_map=no ...\(dq\&
This feature should better be disabled for normal use.  Default: no
.IP "gdk_debug"
You can enable debug output for specific kernel operations.  By default
debug is switched off for obvious reasons.  The value of gdk_debug is an
integer, which value can be (a combination of):
.EX
          1 = thread-specific debug output
          2 = CHECKMASK    = property enforcing on new BATs
          4 = MEMMASK      = memory allocation
          8 = PROPMASK     = property checking on all values:
                             tells about wrongly set properties
         16 = IOMASK       = major IO activity
         32 = BATMASK      = BAT handling
         64 = PARSEMASK    = parser debugging

    2097152 = ALGOMASK     = show join/select algorithm chosen
    4194304 = ESTIMASK     = show result size estimations
                             (for join, select)
    8388608 = XPROPMASK    = extended property checking:
                             tells also about not set properties
   16777216 = JOINPROPMASK = disable property checking with
                             join & outerjoin (e.g., for
                             performance measurements)
   33554432 = DEADBEEFMASK = disable "cleaning" of freed memory
                             in GDKfree() (e.g., for performance
                             measurements)
   67108864 = ALLOCMASK    = exhaustive GDK malloc & free tracing
                             for debugging (GDK developers, only)
  134217728 = OPTMASK      = trace the actions, decisions and
                             effects of MAL optimizers
  268435456 = EXTENDMASK   = trace/debug HEAPextend;
                             used only for development & debugging
  536870912 = FORCEMITOMASK = forcefully activate mitosis even on
                              small tables, i.e., split small tables
                              in as many (tiny) pieces as there are
                              cores (threads) available;
                              this allows us to test mitosis
                              functionality without requiring large
                              data sets (--- at the expense of a
                              potentially significant interpretation
                              overhead for unnecessary large plans);
                              used only for development & testing;
                              set automatically by Mtest.py
.EE

Note that mserver5 recognizes a series of command line options that sets
one or more of these debug flags as well:
.EX
  --threads       (1 | PARMASK)
  --memory        (MEMMASK)
  --properties    (CHECKMASK | PROPMASK | BATMASK)
  --io            (IOMASK | PERFMASK)
  --transactions  (TMMASK | DELTAMASK | TEMMASK)
  --modules       (DLMASK | LOADMASK)
  --algorithms    (ALGOMASK | ESTIMASK)
  --xproperties   (XPROPMASK )
  --performance   (JOINPROPMASK | DEADBEEFMASK)
  --optimizers    (OPTMASK)
  --forcemito     (FORCEMITOMASK)
.EE

Default: 0

.SH "MSERVER5 PARAMETERS"
mserver5 instructs the GDK kernel through the MAL (MonetDB Assembler
Language) language.  MonetDB 5 contains an extensive optimiser framework
to transform MAL plans into more optimal or functional (e.g.
distributed) plans.  These parameters control behaviour on the MAL
level.
.IP "mal_listing"
You can enable the server listing the parsed MAL program for any
script parsed on the command line.  The value of mal_listing is an
integer that have the following possible values:
.EX
   0 = Disable
   1 = List the original input
   2 = List the MAL instruction
   4 = List the MAL type information
   8 = List the MAL UDF type
  16 = List the MAL properties
  32 = List the hidden details
  64 = List the bat tuple count
.EE

Default: 0
.IP "monet_vault_key"
The authorisation tables inside mserver5 can be encrypted with a key,
such that reading the BATs does not directly disclose any credentials.
The
.I monet_vault_key
setting points to a file that stores a secret key to unlock the password
vault.  It can contain anything.  The file is read up to the first
null-byte ('\0'), hence it can be padded to any length
with trailing null-bytes to obfuscate the key
length.  Generating a key can be done for example by using a tool such
as
.B pwgen
and adding a few of the passwords generated.  Make sure not to chose a
too small key.  Note that on absence of a vault key file, some default
key is used to encrypt the authorisation tables.
Changing this setting (effectively changing the key) for an existing
database makes that database unusable as noone is any longer able to
login.  If you use
.BR monetdbd (1),
a per-database vault key is set.

.SH "SQL PARAMETERS"
The SQL component of MonetDB 5 runs on top of the MAL environment.  It
has its own SQL-level specific settings.
.IP "sql_debug"
Enable debugging using a mask.  This option should normally be disabled
(0).  Default: 0
.IP "sql_optimizer"
The default SQL optimizer pipeline can be set per server.  See the
optpipe setting in
.BR monetdb (1)
when using monetdbd.  During SQL
initialization, the optimizer pipeline is checked against the
dependency information maintained in the optimizer library to ensure
there are no conflicts and at least the pre-requisite optimizers are
used.  The setting of sql_optimizer can be either the list of
optimizers to run, or one or more variables containing the optimizer
pipeline to run.  The latter is provided for readability purposes
only.  Default: default_pipe
.P
The following are possible pipes to use:
.IP "minimal_pipe"
The minimal pipeline necessary by the server to operate correctly.
minimal_pipe=inline,remap,deadcode,multiplex,garbageCollector
.IP "default_pipe"
The default pipe line contains as of Feb2010
mitosis-mergetable-reorder, aimed at large tables and improved
access locality.
default_pipe=inline,remap,evaluate,costModel,coercions,emptySet,aliases,mitosis,mergetable,deadcode,commonTerms,joinPath,reorder,deadcode,reduce,dataflow,history,multiplex,garbageCollector
.IP "no_mitosis_pipe"
The no_mitosis pipe line is identical to the default pipeline, except
that optimizer mitosis is omitted.  It is used mainly to make some tests
work deterministically, and to check/debug whether "unexpected" problems
are related to mitosis (and/or mergetable).
no_mitosis_pipe=inline,remap,evaluate,costModel,coercions,emptySet,aliases,mergetable,deadcode,commonTerms,joinPath,reorder,deadcode,reduce,dataflow,history,multiplex,garbageCollector
.IP "sequential_pipe"
The sequential pipe line is identical to the default pipeline, except
that optimizers mitosis & dataflow are omitted.  It is use mainly to
make some tests work deterministically, i.e., avoid ambigious output, by
avoiding parallelism.
sequential_pipe=inline,remap,evaluate,costModel,coercions,emptySet,aliases,mergetable,deadcode,commonTerms,joinPath,reorder,deadcode,reduce,history,multiplex,garbageCollector
.IP "nov2009_pipe"
The default pipeline used in the November 2009 release.
nov2009_pipe=inline,remap,evaluate,costModel,coercions,emptySet,aliases,mergetable,deadcode,constants,commonTerms,joinPath,deadcode,reduce,dataflow,history,multiplex,garbageCollector
.P
Debugging the optimizer pipeline The best way is to use mdb and inspect
the information gathered during the optimization phase.  Several
optimizers produce more intermediate information, which may shed light
on the details.  The opt_debug bitvector controls their output. It can
be set to a pipeline or a comma separated list of optimizers you would
like to trace. It is a server wide property and can not be set
dynamically, as it is intended for internal use.

.SH "CONFIG FILE FORMAT"
The conf-file readable by mserver5 consists of parameters of the form
\(dq\&name=value\(dq\&.
.P
The file is line-based, each newline-terminated line represents either a
comment or a parameter.
.P 
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.  Whitespace
before or after the first equals sign is not stripped.  Trailing
whitespace in a parameter value is retained verbatim.
.P 
Any line beginning with a hash (#) is ignored, as are lines containing
only whitespace.
.P 
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all a string
where quotes are not needed, and if written be part of the string.
