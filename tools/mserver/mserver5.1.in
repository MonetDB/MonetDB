.TH MSERVER5 1 "APRIL 2011" MonetDB "MonetDB Applications"
.SH NAME
mserver5 \- the MonetDB server version 5
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mserver5
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mserver5
is the current MonetDB server that performs all processing on request
of clients for a certain database.
.P
Note that while
.I mserver5
is the process that does the actual work, it is usually more common to
start, monitor and connect to the
.I mserver5
process through
.IR monetdbd (1).
.P
This man-page describes the options that
.I mserver5
understands.
It is intended for people who really need to work with
.I mserver5
itself.
In regular cases, the programs
.IR monetdbd (1)
and
.IR monetdb (1)
control the many options, and allow to adjust them to appropriate
values where sensible.
For normal usage, it is preferred to apply any configuration through
these programs.
.SH OPERATION
When the build-time configuration did not disable this, a
.I mserver5
process presents the user with a console prompt.
On this prompt, MAL commands can be executed.  The architecture is
setup to handle multiple streams of requests.
The first thread started represents the server, which is the console
prompt, reading from standard input and writing to standard output.
.P
The server thread started remains in existence until all other threads
die.
The server is stopped by sending it a termination signal (SIGINT,
SIGTERM, SIGQUIT).
.SH MSERVER5 OPTIONS
.I Mserver5
can be started with options as arguments.
.TP

Set debug level.  This is mostly for debugging purposes.
The value is an integer, which can be (a bit-wise OR of):
.EX
          \fB1\fP = THRDMASK     = thread-specific debug output
          \fB2\fP = CHECKMASK    = property enforcing on new BATs
          \fB8\fP = PROPMASK     = property checking on all values:

         \fB16\fP = IOMASK       = major IO activity
         \fB32\fP = BATMASK      = BAT handling
        \fB128\fP = PARMASK      = Thread management
        \fB512\fP = TMMASK       = Transaction management
       \fB1024\fP = TEMMASK      = Locks and Triggers

   \fB16777216\fP = NOSYNCMASK   = disable forcefully synchronizing files
                             to disk.  If this flag is set, there is
                             no guarantee that the database remains
                             consistent after a crash.  DO NOT USE
                             (unless you really don't care about your
                             data).
   \fB33554432\fP = DEADBEEFMASK = disable "cleaning" of freed memory
                             in GDKfree() which only happens in a
                             debug build (i.e. with assertions
                             enabled) e.g., for performance
                             measurements
   \fB67108864\fP = ALLOCMASK    = exhaustive GDK malloc & free tracing
                             for debugging (GDK developers, only)
  \fB134217728\fP = OPTMASK      = trace the actions, decisions and

  \fB268435456\fP = HEAPMASK     = trace/debug HEAPextend;
                             used only for development & debugging
  \fB536870912\fP = FORCEMITOMASK = forcefully activate mitosis even on
                              small tables, i.e., split small tables
                              in as many (tiny) pieces as there are
                              cores (threads) available;
                              this allows us to test mitosis
                              functionality without requiring large
                              data sets (\(em at the expense of a
                              potentially significant interpretation
                              overhead for unnecessarily large plans);
                              used only for development & testing;
                              set automatically by Mtest.py
.EE
The
.I value
together with the
.B =
sign is optional.  If not specified, it defaults to
.BR 1 .
In the short form \fB\-d\fP, the value, if present, must immediately
(i.e. without space) follow the option.
The values of multiple instances of this flag are OR-ed together.
.TP

.TP
.B \-\-read\-password\-initialize\-and\-exit
Read an unencrypted password from standard input and use it to set the
password for the
.B monetdb
administrator user, initialize the database, and exit.
If the database was already initialized, the administrator password is
not changed.
This option is used by
.IR monetdbd (1)
when creating a new database with an administrator password and should
not be used otherwise.
.SH MSERVER5 PARAMETERS
.I Mserver5
instructs the GDK kernel through the MAL (MonetDB Assembler Language)
language.
MonetDB 5 contains an extensive optimiser framework to transform MAL
plans into more optimal or functional (e.g.  distributed) plans.
These parameters control behaviour on the MAL level.
.TP
.B monet_vault_key
The authorisation tables inside
.I mserver5
can be encrypted with a key, such that reading the BATs does not
directly disclose any credentials.
The
.B monet_vault_key
setting points to a file that stores a secret key to unlock the
password vault.
It can contain anything.
The file is read up to the first null-byte ('\e0'), hence it can be
padded to any length with trailing null-bytes to obfuscate the key
length.
Generating a key can be done for example by using a tool such as
.I pwgen
and adding a few of the passwords generated.
Make sure not to choose a too small key.
Note that on absence of a vault key file, some default key is used to
encrypt the authorisation tables.
Changing this setting (effectively changing the key) for an existing
database makes that database unusable as noone is any longer able to
login.
If you use
.IR monetdbd (1),
a per-database vault key is set.
.TP
.B max_clients
Controls how many client slots are allocated for clients to connect.
This settings limits the maximum number of connected clients at the
same time.
Note that MonetDB is not designed to handle massive amounts of
connected clients.
The funnel capability from
.IR monetdbd (1)
might be a more suitable solution for such workloads.
Default
.BR 64 .
.TP
.B mapi_usock
The name of the UNIX domain socket file on which the server will
listen for connections.
If the name contains the substring
.BR ${PORT} ,
that part will be replaced by the decimal representation of the TCP/IP
port (option
.BR mapi_port ).
This is especially useful if the port was specified as
.BR 0 .
Note, there is usually a severe system-imposed length limitation on
the name of the file.
.TP
.B mapi_port
The TCP/IP port number on which the server will listen for
connections.
This is only used if the value of the
.B mapi_listenaddr
option is not equal to
.BR none .
Default
.BR 50000 .
If the value is
.BR 0 ,
the server will use a so called ephemeral port, i.e. one that is
assigned by the system.
After successfully starting to listen to a port, the value of the port
can be retrieved from the file
.B .conn
inside the database 
.RB ( \-\-dbpath )
directory.
.TP
.B mapi_listenaddr
The TCP/IP interface on which the server will listen for connections.
Possibilites are:
.RS
.TP
.B localhost
The server listens only on the IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interface.
This is the default.
.TP
.B 127.0.0.1
The server listens only on the IPv4 loopback interface.
.TP
.B ::1
The server listens only on the IPv6 loopback interface.
.TP
.B all
The server listens on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.
.TP
.B 0.0.0.0
The server listens on all IPv4 interfaces.
.TP
.B ::
The server listens on all IPv6 interfaces.
.TP
.B none
The server will not listen on any TCP/IP interface (you need to use
the UNIX domain socket interface).
.TP
.I hostname
The server will listen on the interface designated by
.I hostname
which is looked up using the normal hostname lookup facilities.
.RE
.SH SQL PARAMETERS
The SQL component of MonetDB 5 runs on top of the MAL environment.
It has its own SQL-level specific settings.
.TP
.B sql_debug
Enable debugging using a mask.
This option should normally be disabled (0).
Default:
.BR 0 .
.TP
.B sql_optimizer
The default SQL optimizer pipeline can be set per server.
See the optpipe setting in
.IR monetdb (1)
when using monetdbd.
During SQL initialization, the optimizer pipeline is checked against
the dependency information maintained in the optimizer library to
ensure there are no conflicts and at least the pre-requisite
optimizers are used.
The setting of sql_optimizer can be either the list of optimizers to
run.
Default:
.BR default_pipe .
.RS
.P
The following are possible pipes to use:
.TP
.B minimal_pipe
The minimal pipeline necessary by the server to operate correctly.
.\" this documentation must be kept in sync with the respective code in monetdb5/optimizer/opt_pipes.c
minimal_pipe=inline,remap,deadcode,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,garbageCollector
.TP
.B default_pipe
The default pipeline contains the mitosis-mergetable-reorder
optimizers, aimed at large tables and improved access locality.
.\" this documentation must be kept in sync with the respective code in monetdb5/optimizer/opt_pipes.c
default_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,deadcode,pushselect,aliases,mitosis,mergetable,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,dataflow,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector
.TP
.B no_mitosis_pipe
The no_mitosis pipeline is identical to the default pipeline, except
that optimizer mitosis is omitted.
It is used mainly to make some tests work deterministically, and to
check/debug whether "unexpected" problems are related to mitosis
(and/or mergetable).
.\" this documentation must be kept in sync with the respective code in monetdb5/optimizer/opt_pipes.c
no_mitosis_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,deadcode,pushselect,aliases,mergetable,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,dataflow,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector
.TP
.B sequential_pipe
The sequential pipeline is identical to the default pipeline, except
that optimizers mitosis & dataflow are omitted.
It is use mainly to make some tests work deterministically, i.e.,
avoid ambigious output, by avoiding parallelism.
.\" this documentation must be kept in sync with the respective code in monetdb5/optimizer/opt_pipes.c
sequential_pipe=inline,remap,costModel,coercions,aliases,evaluate,emptybind,deadcode,pushselect,aliases,mergetable,aliases,constants,commonTerms,projectionpath,deadcode,reorder,matpack,querylog,multiplex,generator,profiler,candidates,postfix,deadcode,wlc,garbageCollector
.RE
.TP
.B embedded_py
Enable embedded Python.  This means Python code can be called from
SQL.
The value is
.B true
or
.B 3
for embedded Python 3.  Note that by enabling embedded Python, users
of the server are allowed to execute arbitrary Python code, and are
therefore able to read and modify all data that the server process has
access to.
.TP
.B embedded_r=true
Enable embedded R.  This means R code can be called from SQL.  Note
that by enabling embedded R, users of the server are allowed to
execute arbitrary R code, and are therefore able to read and modify
all data that the server process has access to.
.TP
.B embedded_c=true
Enable embedded C.  This means C code can be called from SQL.  The C
code will first be compiled and then executed.  This means a C
compiler must be available.  Note also that by enabling embedded C,
users of the server are allowed to execute arbitrary C code, and are
therefore able to read and modify all data that the server process has
access to.  In addition, if the C code causes a crash, all bets are
off.
.TP
.B raw_strings=true
The boolean option raw_strings controls how the sql scanner interprets string
literals. If the value is
.B false
then strings are interpreted as if they were delimited with E-quotes, that is
strings are interpreted as C strings and backslash characters are needed to
escape special characters. If the value is
.B true
then strings are interpreted as if they were delimited with R-quotes, that is
all characters are interpreted literally. Single quote characters need to be
doubled inside strings. The default value is
.BR false .
.SH CONFIG FILE FORMAT
The configuration file readable by
.I mserver5
consists of parameters of the form \(dq\&\fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP\(dq\&.
The file is line-based, each newline-terminated line represents either
a comment or a parameter.
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant.
Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is not stripped.
Trailing whitespace in a parameter value is retained verbatim.
Any line beginning with a hash
.RB ( # )
is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all a string
where quotes are not needed, and if written be part of the string.
