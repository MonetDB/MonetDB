.SH NAME
monetdb \- control a MonetDB Database Server instance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B monetdb
[monetdb_options] command [command_options] [command_args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B monetdb
allows an administrator of the MonetDB Database Server to perform
various operations on the databases in the server.  It relies on
.BR monetdbd (1)
running in the background for all operations.
.SH OPTIONS
.I monetdb_options
affect all commands and control the general behaviour of
.BR monetdb .
.IP "\-q"
Supresses all standard progress messages, only writing output to stderr
if an error occurred.
.IP "\-h hostname"
Connect to
.I hostname
instead of attempting a connection over the local UNIX socket.  This
allows
.B monetdb
to connect to a remote
.BR monetdbd (1).
The use of this option requires \-P (see below).
.IP "\-p port"
Connects to the given portnumber instead of the default (50001).
Requires \-h to be given as option too.
.IP "\-P passphrase"
Specifies the passphrase necessary to login to a remote
.BR monetdbd (1).
This option requires \-h to be given as well.  A bad passphrase causes
.B monetdb
to fail to login, and hence fail to perform any remote action.
.IP "\-v"
Show version, equal to
.IR "monetdb version" .
.SH COMMANDS
The commands for the
.B monetdb
utility are
.BR create ", " destroy ", " lock ", " release ", " status ", " start ", " stop ", " kill ", " set ", " get ", " inherit ", " discover ", " help " and " version .
The commands facilitate adding, removing, maintaining, starting and
stopping a database inside the MonetDB Database Server.
.P
For all commands, database arguments can be glob-like expressions.
This allows to do wildcard matches.  For details on the syntax, see
.IR EXPRESSIONS .
.IP "create database [database ...]"
Initialises a new database in the MonetDB Database Server.  A database
created with this command makes it available under its database name,
but not yet for use by clients, as the database is put into maintenance
mode.  This allows the database administrator to perform initialisation
steps before releasing it to users.  See also
.BR "monetdb lock" .
The name of the database must match the expression [A\-Za\-z0\-9\-_]+.
.IP "destroy [\-f] database [database ...]"
Removes the given database, including all its data and logfiles.  Once
destroy has completed, all data is lost.  Be careful when using this
command.
.IP "  \-f"
By default, a confirmation question is asked, however the
.I \-f
option, when provided, suppresses this question and removal is executed
right away.  Note that you cannot destroy a running database, bring it
down first using the
.B stop
command.
.IP "lock database [database ...]"
Puts the given database in maintenance mode.  A database under
maintenance can only be connected to by an administrator account
(by default the 
.I monetdb
account).  A database which is under maintenance is not started
automatically by
.BR monetdbd (1),
the MonetDB Database Server, when clients request for it.  Use the
.B release
command to bring the database back for normal usage.  To start a
database which is under maintenance for administrator access, the
.B start
command can be used.
.IP "release database [database ...]"
Brings back a database from maintenance mode.  A released database is
available again for normal use by any client, and is started on demand.
Use the
.B lock
command to take a database under maintenance.
.IP "status [\-lc] [\-s states] [database ...]"
Shows the state of the given database, or, when none given, all known
databases.
Three modes control the level of detail in the displayed
output.  By default a condensed one-line output per database format is
used.  This output resembles pretty much the output of various
.B xxxstat
programs, and is ideal for quickly gaining an overview of the system
state.
.IP "  \-c"
The
.I \-c
flag shows the most used properties of a database.  This includes the
state of the database (running, crashed, stopped), whether it is under
maintenance or not, the crash averages and uptime statistics.  The crash
average is the number of times the database has crashed over the last 1,
15 or 30 starts.  The lower the average, the healthier the database is.
.IP "  \-l"
Triggered by the
.I \-l
flag, a long listing is used.  This listing spans many rows with on each
row one property and its value separated by a colon (`:').  The long
listing includes all information that is available.
.IP "  \-s"
The
.I \-s
flag controls which databases are being shown, matching their state.
The required argument to this flag can be a combination of any of the
following characters.  Note that the order in which they are put also
controls the order in which the databases are printed.
.I r, s, c
and
.I l
are used to print a started (running), stopped, crashed and locked
database respectively.  The default order which is used when the
.I \-s
flag is absent, is
.I rscl.
.IP "start [\-a] database [database ...]"
.IP "stop [\-a] database [database ...]"
.IP "kill [\-a] database [database ...]"
Starts, stops or kills the given database, or, when
.I "  \-a"
is supplied, all known databases.  The
.B kill
command immediately sends a SIGKILL and should only be used as last
resort for a database that doesn't respond any more.  Killing a database
may result in (partial) data loss.
It is more common to use the
.B stop
command to stop a database.  It will first attempt to stop the database,
waiting for
.I mero_exittimeout
seconds and if that fails, kill the database.
When using the
.B start
command,
.BR monetdb (1)
will output diagnostic messages if the requested action failed.  When
encountering an error, one should always consult the logfile of
.BR monetdbd (1)
for more details.  For the
.B kill
command a diagnostic message indicating the database has crashed is
always emitted, due to the nature of that command.
Note that in combination with
.I \-a
the return code of
.BR monetdb (1)
indicates failure if one of the databases had a failure, even though
the operation on other databases was successful.
.IP "get <all | property[,property[,..]]> [database ...]"
Prints the requested properties, or all known properties, for the given
database.  For each property its source and value are printed.  Source
indicates where the current value comes from, e.g. the configuration
file, or a local override.
.IP "set property=value database [database ...]"
Sets property to value for the given database.  For a list of
properties, run
.BR "monetdb get all" .
Most properties require the database to be stopped when set.  The
following properties have special values, or do not have an equivalent
in
.BR monetdb5.conf (5).
.IP "  forward=<redirect|proxy>"
When set to redirect, monetdbd tells each connecting client to make a
new connection directly to the database the client looks for.  This
requires that the separate mserver5 processes are reachable by the ports
they use.  Since this may not be the case due to a firewall, when set to
proxy, monetdbd tunnels the client to the right database.
.IP "  share=<yes|no|tag>"
Defines if and how the database is being announced to other monetdbds
or not.  If not set to
.I "yes"
or
.I "no
the database is simply announced or not.  Using a string, called
.I tag
the database is shared using that tag, allowing for more sophisticated
usage.  For information about the tag format and use, see section
.I "REMOTE DATABASES"
in the
.BR monetdbd (1)
manpage.  Note that this property can be set for a running database, and
that a change takes immediate effect in the network.
.IP "  master=<yes|no|id>"
Defines if the database is to be started as a replication master 
.RI ( yes ", " id "), or not (" no ).
Replication masters are identified by slaves by their
.IR id .
When no
.I id
is given (when
.I yes
is given as argument), a UUID is generated for the master.  Note that
the
.I id
is not required to be in the format of a UUID (see
.BR uuid_generate (3)).
.IP "  slave=<uri>"
Defines if the database is to be started as a replication slave from the
master identified by
.IR uri .
A valid URI looks like
.BI mapi:monetdb:// hostname : port / database
which is a regular mapi URI.
.IP "  readonly=<yes|no>"
Defines if the database has to be started in readonly mode.
.IP "inherit property database [database ...]"
Like set, but unsets the database-local value, and reverts to inherit
from the default again.
.IP "discover [expression]"
Returns a list of remote monetdbds and database URIs
that were discovered by
.BR monetdbd (1).
All databases listed can be connected to via the local MonetDB Database
Server as if it were local databases using their database name.  The
connection is redirected or proxied based on configuration settings.  If
.I expression
is given, only those discovered databases are returned for which their
URI matches the expression.  The expression syntax is described in the
section
.IR EXPRESSIONS .
Next to database URIs the hostnames and ports for monetdbds that
allow to be controlled remotely can be found in the discover list masked
with an asterisk.  These entries can easily be filtered out using an
expression (e.g. "mapi:monetdb:*") if desired.  The control entries come
in handy when one wants to get an overview of available monetdbds in
e.g. a local cluster.  Note that for monetdbd to announce its control
port, the
.I mero_controlport
setting for that monetdbd must be enabled in the configuration file.
.IP \-h
.IP "help [command]"
Shows general help, or short help for a given command.
.IP \-v
.IP version
Shows the version of the
.B monetdb
utility.
.SH "EXPRESSIONS"
For various options, typically database names, expressions can be used.
These expressions are
limited shell-globbing like, where the * in any position is expanded to
an arbitrary string.  The * can occur multiple times in the expression,
allowing for more advanced matches.  Note that the empty string also
matches the *, hence "de*mo" can return "demo" as match.  To match the
literal '*' character, one has to escape it using a backslash, e.g.
"\\*".
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.B monetdb
utility returns exit code
.B 0
if it successfully performed the requested command.  An error caused by
user input or database state is indicated by exit code
.BR 1 .
If an internal error in the utility occurs, exit code
.B 2
is returned.
.SH FILES
.I @MONETDB5_CONFFILE@
.RS
The configuration file for MonetDB, located in the system configuration
directory.  This file can be overridden by setting
.I MONETDB5CONF
in the enviroment.
