- Added "loglevel" property for monetdbd logging (to merovingian.log).
  The loglevel can be set to: error or warning or information or debug.
  The loglevel property can be changed dynamically via command:
   monetdbd set loglevel=warning /path/to/dbfarm
  Default the loglevel is set to: information
  When loglevel is error, only errors are logged.
  When loglevel is warning, errors and warnings are logged.
  When loglevel is information, errors and warnings and information messages
  are logged.  When loglevel is debug, all messages are logged.

* Fri Feb 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- There is now a loadmodules property that can be used to add --loadmodule
  arguments to the mserver5 command line.  See the monetdb and mserver5
  manual pages.
