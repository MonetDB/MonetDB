- The monetdb get, inherit, lock and release commands are extended with
  ‘apply-to-all’ syntax similar to related functionality:
  Usage:
  monetdb set property=value [database ...] sets property to value for
  the given database(s), or all
  for a list of properties, use `monetdb get all`
  Usage: monetdb inherit property [database ...] unsets property,
  reverting to its inherited value from the default configuration for the
  given database(s), or all
  Usage: monetdb lock [-a] database [database
  ...] Puts the given database in maintenance mode.  A database under
  maintenance can only be connected to by the DBA.  A database which
  is under maintenance is not started automatically.  Use the "release"
  command to bring the database back for normal usage.
  Options:
    -a  locks all known databases
  Usage: monetdb release [-a] database [database ...] Brings back a
  database from maintenance mode.  A released database is available
  again for normal use.  Use the "lock" command to take a database
  under maintenance.
  Options:
    -a  releases all known databases
