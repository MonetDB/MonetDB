TABLE 	(card MULTI)
	-> flags	TABLE_PROD_FUNC, TABLE_FROM_RELATION, TRIGGER_WRAPPER
			cases 
			TABLE_PROD_FUNC) TABLE producing function 
			TABLE_FROM_RELATION) RELATIONAL subquery which is dynamically wrapped
			    into function call (needed of remote calls)
			TRIGGER_WRAPPER) for triggers inserts, deletes and updates (new/old values)
				flags 
				r is list of stmts
	-> exps		is list of column expressions (also used for aliases)
	-> l 		optional input relation
	-> r		table function expression

/* Wrapping relational operator, is a big complex top level only 
   operator, which only does DDL kind of statements
 */
DDL 	(card 0!, top of the tree always)
	-> flags	/* OUTPUT, TRANSACTION-types, CREATE/DROP/ALTER* */ 
	-> exps		For 'OUTPUT' is list of output options, for ddl_exception is a list of psm_exception
			For 'transactions' simple flags
			for CREATE etc full sql string.
	-> l		used in ddl_output as the relation to output and ddl_exception as a ddl_list
	-> r		used in ddl_list and ddl_exception

SELECT 	(card MULTI or same ...?) 
	-> exps		selection expressions (ie all e_cmp or e_atom of type bit)
	-> l		is relation

LEFT|RIGHT|FULL
JOIN 	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		join expressions (ie all e_cmp or e_atom of type bit)
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is right relation
	-> flag		LEFT (keep left order, only used during code generation)

SEMI/ANTI 
	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		join expressions (ie all e_cmp or e_atom of type bit)
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is right relation

UNION|EXCEPT|INTERSECT 
	(card ATOM, AGGR or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	is list of projection expressions
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is right relation

PROJECT  (card ATOM, AGGR or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	is list of projection expressions
	-> l		is relation
	-> r		optional, is list of order by expressions 

GROUPBY  (card ATOM (no group by exps), AGGR)
	-> exps		is list of (groupby and) aggregate expressions
	-> l		is relation
	-> r 		is list of group by expressions

TOPN	(card ATOM, AGGR, or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	(list) lng limit, [ lng offset ] -> if the limit is a NULL value, then it's ignored, ie only the offset will be used
	-> l		is relation
	-> flag 	(bounds for limit can be including (1) or excluding (0) (ie later just returns the topN, including will return atleast N)

SAMPLE	(card ATOM, AGGR, or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps		first is either an lng for rownumbers or double between [0,1] for percentage. An optional second contains an int for the seed value. -> if the first value is a NULL, then it's ignored, ie only the offset will be used
	-> l		is relation
	-> flag		(0) no flags

INSERT|DELETE|UPDATE|TRUNCATE 	(card MULTI)
	-> l 		is relation to modify
	-> r		to be inserted/deleted/updated relation
			For update the ->r projection joins in current
			values for 'none' updated columns. Not used in truncate.

	-> flag		(if set don't insert (is done already))
only (UPDATE)
	-> exps		
			Named columns to update
only (TRUNCATE)
	-> exps		
			The first expression is a e_atom integer indicating to restart sequences, and the second is another e_atom integer telling to cascade the truncate if the table has fk dependents

INSERT/UPDATE have a special case 	

			for inserts/updates with indices a double
			relation is used as we need to keep access to
			the bottom value relation
