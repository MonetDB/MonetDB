BASETABLE
	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		is list of column expressions (also used for aliases)
	-> l		(sql_table)

TABLE 	(card MULTI)
	-> flags	0, 1, 2 
			cases 
			0) TABLE producing function 
			1) RELATIONAL subquery which is dynamically wrapped
			    into function call (needed of remote calls)
			2) WRAPPER for inserts, deletes and updates (new/old values)
				flags 
				r is list of stmts
	-> exps		is list of column expressions (also used for aliases)
	-> l 		optional input relation
	-> r		table function expression
		

/* Wrapping relational operator, is a big complex top level only 
   operator, which only does DDL kind of statements
 */
DDL 	(card 0!, top of the tree always)
	-> flags	/* OUTPUT, TRANSACTION-types, CREATE/DROP/ALTER* */ 
	-> exps		For 'OUTPUT' is list of output options
			For 'transactions' simple flags
			for CREATE etc full sql string.
	-> l		only used for 'OUTPUT' relation to output
	-> r		(only for DDL_LIST)

SELECT 	(card MULTI or same ...?) 
	-> exps		selection expressions (ie all e_cmp)
	-> l		is relation

LEFT|RIGHT|FULL
JOIN 	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		join expressions (ie all e_cmp)
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is rigth relation
	-> flag		LEFT (keep left order, only used during code generation)

SEMI/ANTI 
	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		join expressions (ie all e_cmp)
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is rigth relation

APPLY
	(card MULTI)
	-> exps		are the bind variables (from the outer, correlated in the subquery)
	-> l		is outer relation
	-> r		is subquery relation

UNION|EXCEPT|INTERSECT 
	(card ATOM, AGGR or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	is list of projection expressions
	-> l		is left relation
	-> r		is rigth relation

PROJECT  (card ATOM, AGGR or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	is list of projection expressions
	-> l		is relation
	-> r		optional, is list of order by expressions 

GROUPBY  (card ATOM (no group by exps), AGGR)
	-> exps		is list of (groupby and) aggregate expressions
	-> l		is relation
	-> r 		is list of group by expressions

TOPN	(card ATOM, AGGR, or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps 	(list) int limit, [ int offset ]
	-> l		is relation
	-> flag 	(bounds for limit can be including (1) or excluding (0) (ie later just returns the topN, including will return atleast N)

SAMPLE	(card ATOM, AGGR, or MULTI (same card as lower relation))
	-> exps		int rownumbers, (todo: double between [0,1] for percentage)
	-> l		is relation
	-> flag		(0) no flags

INSERT|DELETE|UPDATE 	(card MULTI)
	-> l 		is relation to modify
	-> r		to be inserted/deleted/updated relation
			For update the ->r projection joins in current
			values for 'none' updated columns.

	-> flag		(if set don't insert (is done already))
only (UPDATE)
	-> exps		
			Named columns to update

INSERT/UPDATE have a special case 	

			for inserts/updates with indices a double
			relation is used as we need to keep access to
			the bottom value relation
