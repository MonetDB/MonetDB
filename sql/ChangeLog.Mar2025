- Added support for reading external data in a generic way via table
  returning function: proto_loader(string uri).  The uri string value
  must start with the scheme name, ending with : character.
  Supported schemes are: monetdb: and odbc:.
  The monetdb scheme allows you to connect to a remote MonetDB server
  and retrieve the data of a specific table or view in a specific schema.
  The uri syntax: monetdb://[<host>[:<port>]]/<database>/<schema>/<table>
  Example: SELECT * FROM proto_loader('monetdb://127.0.0.1:50000/demo_db/sys/tables');
  The odbc scheme allows you to connect to any ODBC data source via
  an ODBC driver and retrieve the data of a supplied query.
  The uri syntax:
   odbc:{{DSN|FILEDSN}=<data source name>|DRIVER=<path_to_driver>};
                      [<ODBC connection parameters>;]QUERY=<SQL query>
  For ODBC you normally configure a data source first. This
  is done using the ODBC administrator (on windows: odbcad32.exe,
  on linux: odbcinst).  Once a data source for a specific ODBC
  driver has been setup using a unique name, you can reference it as:
  DSN=my_bigdata; or FILE_DSN=/home/usernm/dsns/my_bigdata;
  If you do not want to setup a data source, you can use DRIVER=...;
  to specify the ODBC driver program to use. However this also means
  you have to specify all the required connection parameters yourself,
  such as UID=...;PWD=...;DATABASE=...; etc.
  The QUERY=<SQL query> part is mandatory and must be specified at the
  end of the uri string, after the optional ODBC connection parameters.
  Examples: SELECT * FROM proto_loader(
  'odbc:DSN=Postgres;UID=claude;PWD=monet;QUERY=SELECT * FROM customers');
  SELECT * FROM proto_loader('odbc:DRIVER=/usr/lib64/libsqlite3odbc.so;
    Database=/home/martin/sqlite3/chinook.db;QUERY=SELECT * FROM customers');
  Note that the 'odbc:' scheme is experimental and not enabled by default.
  To enable it the MonetDB server has to be started with argument:
   --loadmodule odbc_loader

* Mon Feb 10 2025 stefanos mavros <stemavros@gmail.com>
- Extended the constant aggregate optimizer in order to eliminate
  aggregates with constant arguments whenever possible.

* Wed Jan 29 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- REMOTE TABLES and REPLICA TABLES now fully support the monetdb://
  and monetdbs:// URL's introduced in Aug2024.
  Any mapi:monetdb:// URL's are normalized to the new style.
- Add function sa_msettings_create() to allocate an msettings object
  using the arena allocator.
- Unused helper function mapiuri_database() has been removed from
  rel_remote.h.

* Fri Dec 20 2024 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl>
- Added support for aggregates which order within the group such
  as quantile and which potentially order within the group such as
  group_concat. The ordering for such operators in now handled once in
  the relational plan. For this the create function statements can now
  have an optional order specification, using the keywords 'ORDERED'
  and 'WITH ORDER'.

* Fri Dec 20 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Added support for recursive CTE's.
- The SQL parser was cleaned up.  This resulted in some keywords being
  used more strictly.  If any of these keywords are to be used as column
  names, they have to be quoted using double quotes: AS, TABLE, COLUMN,
  DISTINCT, EXEC, EXECUTE.

* Tue Oct  8 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Introduce the RETURNING clause for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
  Specifying a RETURNING clause causes the SQL statement to return the
  modified records which can be queried using SELECT like expressions
  in the RETURNING clause. Aggregate functions are allowed.
  This is a common non-standard SQL extension.

  Examples:

  INSERT INTO foo values (1,10), (-1,-10) RETURNING i+2*j AS bar
  ----
  21
  -21

  UPDATE foo SET i = -i WHERE i >0 RETURNING sum(j), count(j)
  ----
  -60|3

* Tue Sep 10 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Introduce division_min_scale SQL environment variable for specifying
  minimum scale of the division result. The default value is 3.
