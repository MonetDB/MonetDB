# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- Number parsing for SQL was fixed.  If a number was immediately followed
  by letters (i.e. without a space), the number was accepted and the
  alphanumeric string starting with the letter was interpreted as an alias
  (if aliases were allowed in that position).
