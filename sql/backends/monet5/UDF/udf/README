This directory is a template for extending SQL with a new user-defined
function (UDF).  For further documentation, see the MonetDB website at
https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-manual/data-types/udf-types
as well as the Mercurial repository at
https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-extend
and especially the file reverse/README.rst in there, which contains a
lot of hands-on information for creating a UDF.
