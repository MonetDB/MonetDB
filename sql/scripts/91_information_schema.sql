-- ISO/IEC SQL/Schemata (as defined in ISO_9075_11_Schemata_2011_E.pdf)
-- defines INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema and standardised views
--
-- NOTE 1: MonetDB does NOT support catalog qualifiers in object names, so
--         all the *CATALOG* columns in next views will allways contain NULL.
-- NOTE 2: Most views have been extended (after the standard columns) with
--         MonetDB specific information columns such as schema_id, table_id,
--         column_id, is_system, etc. This simplifies filtering and joins with
--         system tables/views in sys or tmp schemas when needed.
