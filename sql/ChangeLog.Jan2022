- If there was an error in one of the special commands to the server
  (e.g. setting the reply size for result sets), the server could get
  into an infinite loop.  This has been fixed.
- Fixed a double cleanup after a failed allocation in COPY INTO.  The
  double cleanup could cause a crash due to a race condition it enabled.
