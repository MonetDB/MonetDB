- [This feature was already released in Jan2022 (11.43), but the ChangeLog was missing] Added SQL procedures sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string), sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string, interval int), sys.stop_vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string). These can be used to vacuum string columns.
