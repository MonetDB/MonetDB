* Wed Aug  3 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- Removed functions sys.zorder_encode, sys.zorder_decode_x, and
  sys.zorder_decode_y.

* Mon Jul 18 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.25.1-20161214

* Wed Jul  6 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.25.1-20161214
- The syntax of bat.new(:oid,:any) has been changed by dropping the
  superflous :oid.  All BATs are now binary associations between a void
  column and a materialized value column.  (except for the internal
  :bat[:void,:void] representation of simple oid ranged tails.)

* Mon Oct 19 2015 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- Disallow GRANT <some-user> TO <role-or-use>.  Only explicitly
  created roles can be granted.

* Sun Oct 18 2015 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- Extended grantable schema privileges: when a user is granted the
  "sysadmin" role, the user now hcan not only create schemas, but
  also drop schemas.
- Introduced COPY INTO/ COPY FROM global privileges. These privileges
  allows other users than 'monetdb' to be granted the privileges
  to use the MonetDB bulk data loading/exporting features, i.e.,
  COPY FROM <file> and COPY INTO <file>.

* Tue Aug 18 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.21.3-20150818
- Differences between time, timestamp, and date values now return properly
  typed interval types (second or month intervals) instead of integers.

* Tue Jul 28 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.21.1-20150807

- A number of bugs were fixed in the code to upgrade a database from
  previous releases.  This version should fix the upgrade of a database
  that had been upgraded to the Oct2014 release, but also properly
  upgrade directly from Jan2014 and Feb2013 releases.

* Wed Apr  9 2014 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.19.1-20141024

  queries in the SQL query cache.

* Sat Apr 13 2013 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.15.7-20130426
- Added TEMPORARY to the non-reserved keywords, ie no need for double
  quotes when used as identifier.

- Databases that were upgraded from the Aug2011 release have an error
  in the catalog for SQL procedures.  This is now fixed.

* Fri Feb 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Fixed a crash that happened at the end of a database upgrade to the
  Dec2011 database scheme.  The crash happened during cleanup after the
  database was upgraded, so it was merely inconvenient.

* Wed Feb 15 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Stripped off implementation-specific parts from error messages before
  they get presented to the user.

* Thu Nov  3 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- mclient: The csv output format can now also be of the form csv=c and
  csv+c where c is the column separator.  The form with csv+ produces
  a single header line with column names.

* Wed Nov  2 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Changed a bug where the sign() function returned the same type as its
  argument instead of always an INTEGER.

* Wed Oct 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.9-20111115
- Added a fix for bug #2834, which caused weird (failing) behaviour

* Fri Sep 16 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- A bug was fixed where deleted rows weren't properly accounted for in
  all operations.  This was bug 2882.
- A bug was fixed which caused an update to an internal table to
  happen too soon.  The bug could be observed on a multicore system
  with a query INSERT INTO t (SELECT * FROM t) when the table t is
  "large enough".  This was bug 2883.

* Tue Jul 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Fixed regression where the superuser password could no longer be
  changed, bug #2844

  part.
- Redirect error from create scripts back to the first client.  This
  fixes bug 2813.

  joinidx).
- Fixed pushing select down.

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
  database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
  databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
  first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
  release.

* Mon Jan 24 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- Fix bug #2648, do not allow restarting a sequence with NULL via the
  result of a sub-query.

* Mon Dec 13 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.40.3-20101215
- Security related fixes to the COPY INTO commands: 1) binary COPY INTO
  is disallowed for non-administrator users, 2) COPY INTO using a path
  both for reading and writing is disallowed for non-administrator users,
  3) paths used with COPY INTO may not be relative, and 4) COPY INTO a
  file may only be writing to a non-existing file

* Mon Oct 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed bug 2695: crash when starting mserver in readonly mode on a
  new database.

* Fri Sep 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed a bug where the server silently ignored the last record in a
  COPY INTO if it was incomplete (e.g. missing a quote).

* Mon Aug 30 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed a crash of the server when an extremely complex query is
  attempted.  This is the latest incarnation of bug 104.

* Fri Aug 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed a case where the optimizer incorrectly removed an expression.
  This fixes bug 2602.
- Fix a crash in prepared statements when a parameter is on the left-hand
  side of a binary operator.  This fixes bug 2599.
- Fixed reporting of a violated foreign key constraint.  This fixes
  bug 2598.
- Certain schema altering queries didn't report success, even though
  they did succeed.  This fixes bug 2589.
- Fixed a crash when a non-existing table was used in an IN clause.
  Fixes bug 2604.
- Fixed bug 2633.  Adding a LIMIT clause could, in certain conditions,
  cause a crash.

* Thu Aug 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.5-20100823
- A bug was fixed where updates were missing in large transaction.
  This fixes bug 2543.
- A memory leak was fixed which caused the server to grow when loading
  and emptying a table.  This was bug 2539.

* Fri Aug 13 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed bug 2643 added more defensive code, when an aggregation function
  doesn't exist

- Fixed bug #2641,  The SQL server now handles Unicode BOM sequences
  occurring in any place.  Previously an "unexpected character (U+FEFF)"
  error would be returned.

* Fri Jul 30 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fix Bug 2611. Fixed check for multiple functions without parameters.
- Fixed bug 2569 (except/union/intersect right after
  insert/delete/update. We now correctly fallback to the more general
  subquery case (not only simple selects (SQL_SELECT)).

* Wed Jul  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Make TEXT a separate keyword, separating it from CLOB, such that we
  can sloppily allow TEXT to appear as a column name, since it seems

- fixed bug 2564: in case group by column is not found as alias in
  projection list, fall back to check plain input columns in order to
  find the underlying BAT and check its sortedness

* Thu Jun 24 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100625
- make it possible to use '?' in offset and limit

* Fri Jun 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.1-20100622
- Added include and .lib files to Windows installers that are needed
  to compile client programs.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Thu Apr  8 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.36.5-20100420
- fixed bug #2983773 "SQL: minimal optimizer pipe unstable"
