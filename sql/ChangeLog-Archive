* Tue Mar 13 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- Implemented group_concat(X,Y) aggregate function which also
  concatenates a column of strings X, but using a supplied string Y as
  the separator. This function is also a SQL extension.

* Fri Mar  9 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- Implemented group_concat(X) aggregate function which concatenates a
  column of strings using a comma as a separator. This function is not
  featured in the SQL standard.

* Thu May 17 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.5-20180525
- Corrected the definition of view: sys.ids.

* Tue Nov 28 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.3-20180327
- Extended support to use CREATE ORDERED INDEX on columns of type: char,
  varchar, clob, blob, url, json, inet and uuid.

* Thu Feb  1 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Added new system view: sys.ids which contains all database objects
  ids which can be used in sys.dependencies table.
- Added new system view: sys.dependencies_vw which shows all data of
  sys.dependencies including names on objects, object types and dependency types.
- Added 25 new system views for finding out dependencies between database objects.
  These new dependency views improve, extend and replace the 17
  sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions as previously defined in
  21_dependency_functions.sql. Those sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions
  are now marked as deprecated.
- Added new system view: sys.roles which contains all defined roles.
- Added new system view: sys.var_values which shows the values for
  system variables.

* Fri Jan 12 2018 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Added support for COMMENT ON statements using SQL syntax:
   COMMENT ON { SCHEMA | TABLE | VIEW | COLUMN | INDEX | SEQUENCE |
              FUNCTION | PROCEDURE | AGGREGATE | FILTER FUNCTION | LOADER }
        qname IS { 'my description text' | NULL | '' } ;
  For COLUMN the qname can be "table_name"."column_name" or fully qualified
  as in: "schema_name"."table_name"."column_name".
  For FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, AGGREGATE, FILTER FUNCTION and LOADER the qname
  may need to include the signature (argument types) to be able to
  differentiate between multiple overloaded functions which have the same name
  and schema.
  By specifying IS NULL or IS '' you remove the comment for the database object.
  If a database object is dropped, the associated comment is also removed.
  Note: it is not allowed or possible to add comments for temporary tables or
        objects in schema "tmp".
  The sql catalog has been extended with system table: sys.comments.
  The keyword 'COMMENT' has now become a reserved keyword.

* Thu Dec  7 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Removed system function sys.environment(). It was a duplicate of system
  function sys.env().

* Thu Nov  9 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Implemented behavior for DROP SCHEMA my_schema RESTRICT command.
  Previously the RESTRICT keyword was accepted but not obeyed. It would
  always do a CASCADE operation.  Also the default behavior of DROP SCHEMA
  my_schema command is now changed into RESTRICT behavior (was CASCADE).

* Tue Nov  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- The internal NULL representation of the REAL (FLOAT) and DOUBLE
  types was changed from the smallest representable finite value to NaN
  (not-a-number).

* Wed Aug 30 2017 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- A column default value can be used in a UPDATE statement: UPDATE tname
  SET cname = DEFAULT, and INSERT statements: INSERT INTO tname VALUES
  (..., DEFAULT, ...)
- Added support for TRUNCATE statements conforming to the SQL:2008 standard:
   TRUNCATE [ TABLE ] qname [ CONTINUE IDENTITY | RESTART IDENTITY ]
            [ RESTRICT | CASCADE ]
  In a TRUNCATE statement a 'CONTINUE IDENTITY' or 'RESTART IDENTITY'
  clause can be passed to restart or not, being the former the default one.
  The 'CASCADE' option instructs to truncate referencing table(s) also if
  the referencing table(s) have foreign key references to this table.
  The default behavior is 'RESTRICT'.
  Note: it is possible to use TRUNCATE statements in a transaction and
  thus to rollback the effects of a truncate.
  The keywords 'TRUNCATE' and 'CONTINUE' have now become reserved keywords.
- Added possibility to GRANT or REVOKE a TRUNCATE privilege to a user or role.
- Added possibility to define a TRIGGER on a TRUNCATE event.
- Added possibility to specify 'OR REPLACE' in following CREATE commands:
   CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW qname ...
   CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER qname ...
- Added possibility to specify 'IF EXIST' in following DROP commands:
   DROP AGGREGATE [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP FILTER FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP LOADER [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP PROCEDURE [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...

* Tue Aug  1 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Lots of changes to streamline the internal error handling.
  In principle, all errors should now include a SQLSTATE error code
  (see the SQL standard).

* Thu Jul 20 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Added support for extracting the quarter (number between 1 and 4)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( QUARTER FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for extracting the week (number between 1 and 53)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( WEEK FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for scalar functions: quarter(date_expr),
  quarter(timestamp_expr) and quarter(timestamptz_expr).

* Thu Mar  2 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Made the operator precedence of % equal to those of * and /.  All three
  are evaluated from left to right.

* Mon Feb  6 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Removed table sys.connections.  It was a remnant of an experimental
  change that had already been removed in 2012.

* Tue Nov  8 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Protect against runaway profiler events If you hit a barrier block
  during profiling, the JSON event log may quickly become unwieldy. Event
  production is protected using a high water mark, which ensures that
  never within the single execution of MAL block the instruction causes
  excessive event records.

* Tue Apr 18 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.19-20170418
- Some memory leaks were plugged.

* Tue Apr 11 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.17-20170411
- Upgrade code was added for an old change in the sys.settimeout function.

- The experimental recycler code is moved to the attic.

* Wed Jul  6 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.25.1-20161214
- The syntax of bat.new(:oid,:any) has been changed by dropping the
  superflous :oid.  All BATs are now binary associations between a void
  column and a materialized value column.  (except for the internal
  :bat[:void,:void] representation of simple oid ranged tails.)

* Mon Oct 19 2015 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- Disallow GRANT <some-user> TO <role-or-use>.  Only explicitly
  created roles can be granted.

* Sun Oct 18 2015 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- Extended grantable schema privileges: when a user is granted the
  "sysadmin" role, the user now hcan not only create schemas, but
  also drop schemas.
- Introduced COPY INTO/ COPY FROM global privileges. These privileges
  allows other users than 'monetdb' to be granted the privileges
  to use the MonetDB bulk data loading/exporting features, i.e.,
  COPY FROM <file> and COPY INTO <file>.

* Tue Aug 18 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.21.3-20150818
- Differences between time, timestamp, and date values now return properly
  typed interval types (second or month intervals) instead of integers.

* Tue Jul 28 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.21.1-20150807

* Tue Feb 17 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.21.1-20150807
- Removed support for RDF.
- Removed DataCell.  It was experimental code that was never enabled.

* Mon Jan 19 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.9-20150123
- Fixed a typo in a column name of the sys.tablestoragemodel view
  (auxillary changed to auxiliary).

* Thu Nov 20 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.5-20141120
- Fixed sys.queue() implementation to report on other queries being
  executed.

- A number of bugs were fixed in the code to upgrade a database from
  previous releases.  This version should fix the upgrade of a database
  that had been upgraded to the Oct2014 release, but also properly
  upgrade directly from Jan2014 and Feb2013 releases.

* Wed Apr  9 2014 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.19.1-20141024
- Added PostgreSQL compatible string TRIM, LTRIM, RTRIM, LPAD and RPAD
  functions

* Fri Dec 13 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.1-20141024
- Stop support for upgrading directly from a database created with a
  server from the Oct2012 release or older.  You can upgrade via the
  Feb2013 or Jan2014 release.

* Tue Nov 19 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.15.19-20131120
- Fixed a bug where the server at some point stopped saving compiled
  queries in the SQL query cache.

* Sat Apr 13 2013 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.15.7-20130426
- Added TEMPORARY to the non-reserved keywords, ie no need for double
  quotes when used as identifier.

* Wed Nov 21 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.13.7-20121212

- Fixed a crash that happened at the end of a database upgrade to the
  Dec2011 database scheme.  The crash happened during cleanup after the
  database was upgraded, so it was merely inconvenient.

* Wed Feb 15 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Stripped off implementation-specific parts from error messages before
  they get presented to the user.

* Thu Nov  3 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- mclient: The csv output format can now also be of the form csv=c and
  csv+c where c is the column separator.  The form with csv+ produces
  a single header line with column names.

* Wed Nov  2 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Changed a bug where the sign() function returned the same type as its
  argument instead of always an INTEGER.

* Wed Oct 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.9-20111115
- Added a fix for bug #2834, which caused weird (failing) behaviour

- Fixed a bug when using default values for interval columns.  Bug 2877.

* Fri Sep 16 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- A bug was fixed where deleted rows weren't properly accounted for in
  all operations.  This was bug 2882.
- A bug was fixed which caused an update to an internal table to
  happen too soon.  The bug could be observed on a multicore system
  with a query INSERT INTO t (SELECT * FROM t) when the table t is
  "large enough".  This was bug 2883.

* Tue Jul 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Fixed regression where the superuser password could no longer be

  joinidx).
- Fixed pushing select down.

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
  database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
  databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
  first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
  release.

* Mon Jan 24 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- Fix bug #2648, do not allow restarting a sequence with NULL via the

* Mon Dec 13 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.40.3-20101215
- Security related fixes to the COPY INTO commands: 1) binary COPY INTO
  is disallowed for non-administrator users, 2) COPY INTO using a path
  both for reading and writing is disallowed for non-administrator users,
  3) paths used with COPY INTO may not be relative, and 4) COPY INTO a
  file may only be writing to a non-existing file

* Mon Oct 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed bug 2695: crash when starting mserver in readonly mode on a
  new database.

  COPY INTO if it was incomplete (e.g. missing a quote).

* Mon Aug 30 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed a crash of the server when an extremely complex query is
  attempted.  This is the latest incarnation of bug 104.

* Fri Aug 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed a case where the optimizer incorrectly removed an expression.
  This fixes bug 2602.
- Fix a crash in prepared statements when a parameter is on the left-hand
  side of a binary operator.  This fixes bug 2599.
- Fixed reporting of a violated foreign key constraint.  This fixes
  bug 2598.

  they did succeed.  This fixes bug 2589.
- Fixed a crash when a non-existing table was used in an IN clause.
  Fixes bug 2604.
- Fixed bug 2633.  Adding a LIMIT clause could, in certain conditions,
  cause a crash.

* Thu Aug 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.5-20100823
- A bug was fixed where updates were missing in large transaction.
  This fixes bug 2543.
- A memory leak was fixed which caused the server to grow when loading
  and emptying a table.  This was bug 2539.

* Fri Aug 13 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed bug 2643 added more defensive code, when an aggregation function
  doesn't exist

- Fixed bug #2641,  The SQL server now handles Unicode BOM sequences
  occurring in any place.  Previously an "unexpected character (U+FEFF)"
  error would be returned.

* Fri Jul 30 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fix Bug 2611. Fixed check for multiple functions without parameters.
- Fixed bug 2569 (except/union/intersect right after
  insert/delete/update. We now correctly fallback to the more general
  subquery case (not only simple selects (SQL_SELECT)).

* Thu Jul 29 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed ORDER BY over UNION etc. (bug 2606) by
  automatically adding select * around select x union select y order by z.

* Wed Jul  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Make TEXT a separate keyword, separating it from CLOB, such that we
  can sloppily allow TEXT to appear as a column name, since it seems
  not to be in the standard as reserved keyword.

* Wed Jul  7 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Fixed bug 2581. Completed the implementation of handling Boolean
  types in prepare statements.

  projection list, fall back to check plain input columns in order to
  find the underlying BAT and check its sortedness

* Thu Jun 24 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100625

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on

- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .
