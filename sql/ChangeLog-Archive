* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
  database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
  databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
  first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
  release.

* Mon Jan 24 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- Fix bug #2648, do not allow restarting a sequence with NULL via the
  result of a sub-query.

* Wed Dec 15 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- Allow clients to release prepared handles using Xrelease commands

* Mon Dec 13 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.40.3-20101215
- Security related fixes to the COPY INTO commands: 1) binary COPY INTO
  is disallowed for non-administrator users, 2) COPY INTO using a path
  both for reading and writing is disallowed for non-administrator users,
  3) paths used with COPY INTO may not be relative, and 4) COPY INTO a
  file may only be writing to a non-existing file

* Mon Oct 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029

* Fri Sep 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed a bug where the server silently ignored the last record in a
  COPY INTO if it was incomplete (e.g. missing a quote).

* Mon Aug 30 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.40.1-20101029
- Fixed a crash of the server when an extremely complex query is
  attempted.  This is the latest incarnation of bug 104.

  side of a binary operator.  This fixes bug 2599.

  bug 2598.

  they did succeed.  This fixes bug 2589.

  Fixes bug 2604.
- Fixed bug 2633.  Adding a LIMIT clause could, in certain conditions,
  cause a crash.

* Thu Aug 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.5-20100823
- A bug was fixed where updates were missing in large transaction.
  This fixes bug 2543.
- A memory leak was fixed which caused the server to grow when loading
  and emptying a table.  This was bug 2539.

* Fri Aug 13 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823

* Mon Aug  9 2010 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823

- Fix Bug 2611. Fixed check for multiple functions without parameters.
- Fixed bug 2569 (except/union/intersect right after
  insert/delete/update. We now correctly fallback to the more general
  subquery case (not only simple selects (SQL_SELECT)).

* Thu Jul 29 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- Fixed ORDER BY over UNION etc. (bug 2606) by

- Fixed bug 2624: function returning decimal returned result that was
  scaled incorrectly.

* Sun Jul 18 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.5-20100823
- fixed bug 2622 "LIMIT & OFFSET ignored on 64-bit big-endian when
  combined with GROUP BY"

* Mon Jul 12 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100712
- Make queries like (SELECT ...) UNION ALL (SELECT ...) ORDER BY ...;
  work, again, that were broken since Jun 22 2010 triggering errors
  like "ORDER BY: missing select operator"

* Fri Jul  9 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100712
- Removed false connection warning about missing SQL script ("could
  not read createdb.sql") received by the client upon first connect on
  a newly created database.  Bug #2591

* Thu Jul  8 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Improved error message for certain type-related problems by
  including the affected column name.

* Wed Jul  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Make TEXT a separate keyword, separating it from CLOB, such that we
  can sloppily allow TEXT to appear as a column name, since it seems
  not to be in the standard as reserved keyword.

* Wed Jul  7 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100709
- Fixed bug 2581. Completed the implementation of handling Boolean
  types in prepare statements.
- Fix bug 2582. Statements with 'constant in ( )' are now handled
  properly.
- Fixed bug 2583 + added test. The assert was incorrect.

* Mon Jul  5 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100706
- Fixed bug in zero_or_one
- Fixed bug in dead code elimination for projections with distinct
- Fixed bug handling join with constant values on both sides (like
  group results and constants)
- fixed bug in UPDATE TABLE when updating multiple rows

* Wed Jun 30 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100706
- fixed bug 2564: in case group by column is not found as alias in
  projection list, fall back to check plain input columns in order to
  find the underlying BAT and check its sortedness

* Thu Jun 24 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100625
- make it possible to use '?' in offset and limit

* Fri Jun 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.1-20100622
- Added include and .lib files to Windows installers that are needed
  to compile client programs.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Thu Apr  8 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.36.5-20100420
- fixed bug #2983773 "SQL: minimal optimizer pipe unstable"
