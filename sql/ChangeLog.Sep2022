* Wed Dec 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed cleanup after a failed allocation where the data being cleaned
  up was unitialized but still used as pointers to memory that also had
  to be freed.

* Wed Dec  7 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed a double cleanup after a failed allocation in COPY INTO.  The
  double cleanup could cause a crash due to a race condition it enabled.
