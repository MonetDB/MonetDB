# the four uncommitted transactions create four new segments, appended to the tail of the segment list;
# the first commit (id=1) does not merge any segments since active transactions prevent it;
# the second commit (id=3) does not merge any segments since there is an uncommitted segment of id=2 between id=1 and id=3;
# the third commit (id=4) is able to merge its segment plus the segment inserted by the transaction id=3,
#  as they are next to each other and the active transaction is not able to read them;
# the fourth commit is able to merge everything, as there are no active transactions and all segments are contiguous.

# there are currently 3 segments, with the middle one referring to three deleted rows;
# the first transaction is read-only;
# the second transaction inserts a new row, which splits the deleted segment into two;
#  it is not merged with the first segment due to the active transaction;
# the third transaction inserts a new row, splitting the delete segment into another two;
#  however, the two new inserted segments are merged, as they are contiguous and the active transactions
#  cannot read them;
# the first transaction commits but the segments remain the same since it is read-only;
# the last transaction inserts another row and commits, merging everything back into one segment.
