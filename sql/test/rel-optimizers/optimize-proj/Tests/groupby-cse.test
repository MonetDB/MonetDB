# this cannot happen since the TOPN/SAMPLE operators are pushed down to
# the projections 

## GROUPBY <--input-- SEMI
# this would not make sense since the alias cannot (probably?) exist in
# the expressions of the semijoin operator. and since the groupby_cse is
# only looking in the lower subrel it will not be triggered

## GROUPBY <--input-- UNION
# TODO: the union operator introduces a distinct in the form of group
# bys which are NOT processed by the groupby-cse optimizer. this must be
# investigated more eg 
# select c1 ca, c1 cb from foo union select c1 ca, c1 cb from bar;

## GROUPBY <--input-- MERGE
