The SQLite sqllogictest *.test files were copied from
http://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/dir?name=test

The *.test files were next converted into *.test.sql variants which
 can be processed by mclient (or any other SQL client tool which accepts .sql scripts).

They are placed in the Tests/ subdir with an All file such that they can be run using Mtest.py

The following issues where detected (and fixed in Jul2015 SP1 release) using the 5 select*.test.sql tests:

Note: we currently do not use the sqllogictest test program to do the tests.
This could be something to add in the future (if desired).
