She is told by the deputy to leave the kitchen of@@@@@@the lodging house because she could not produce her@@@@@@doss money. Polly, on leaving, asks him to save a@@@@@@bed for her. "Never Mind!" She says, "I'll soon get@@@@@@my doss money. See what a jolly bonnet I've got@@@@@@now." She indicates a little black bonnet which no@@@@@@one had seen before.

Buck's Row by Charles Cross
2:30 AM
She meets Emily Holland, who was returning from@@@@@@watching the Shadwell Dry Dock fire, outside of a@@@@@@grocer's shop on the corner of Whitechapel Road and@@@@@@Osborn Street. Polly had come down Osborn Street.@@@@@@Holland describes her as "very drunk and staggered@@@@@@against the wall." Holland calls attention to the@@@@@@church clock striking 2:30. Polly tells Emily that@@@@@@she had had her doss money three times that day and@@@@@@had drunk it away. She says she will return to@@@@@@Flower and Dean Street where she could share a bed@@@@@@with a man after one more attempt to find trade.@@@@@@"I've had my doss money three times today and spent@@@@@@it." She says, "It won't be long before I'm back."@@@@@@The two women talk for seven or eight minutes. Polly@@@@@@leaves walking east down Whitechapel Road.@@@@@@At the time, the services of a destitute prostitute@@@@@@like Polly Nichols could be had for 2 or 3 pence or@@@@@@a stale loaf of bread. 3 pence was the going rate as@@@@@@that was the price of a large glass of gin.
