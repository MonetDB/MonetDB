# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Tue Jul 16 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The "phash" column in the sys.storage() table now indicates whether a
  hash exists.  If the hash is not loaded but there is a hash available
  on disk, the phash value is "true", but the "hashes" value is 0.

* Thu Jul 11 2024 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added execution privilege on all sys.generate_series(first, limit)
  and sys.generate_series(first, limit, stepsize) functions to public,
  so all users can now call these table producing generator functions.

* Fri Jun 14 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Extend CREATE USER MAX_MEMORY and ALTER USER MAX_MEMORY to accept
  strings of the form '10MiB', '10G', etc.

* Wed May 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Extended view sys.sessions and function sys.sessions() with new columns:
  language, peer, hostname, application, client, clientpid and remark.
- All users now have SELECT privilege on view sys.sessions, but non-admin
  users only see their own sessions.
- Added procedure sys.setclientinfo(property string, value string)
  to allow the client application to set a specific client info property.
- Added system table sys.clientinfo_properties that lists the supported
  client info properties and their associated column name in sys.sessions view.
  It contains property names: ClientHostname, ApplicationName,
  ClientLibrary, ClientPid and ClientRemark.

* Mon May 13 2024 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl>
- Extended sys.generate_series() to generate dates. Added 2 new functions:
  sys.generate_series(first date, "limit" date, stepsize interval month) and
  sys.generate_series(first date, "limit" date, stepsize interval day).

* Wed May  8 2024 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl>
- Added support for select exp, count(*) group by 1 order by 1;
  ie. using numeric references in group by clause.
- Added support for GROUP BY ALL. This finds all expressions from the
  selections which aren't aggregations and groups on those.
  At least one aggregation must be specified.
  The ALL keyword can also be replaced by '*', so: GROUP BY *.
- Added support for ORDER BY ALL. This orders on all columns of the selection.
  The ALL keyword can also be replaced by '*', so: ORDER BY *.

* Thu May  2 2024 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Removed the obsolete ANALYZE statement syntax options: SAMPLE nn and
  MINMAX. Both options have been ignored since release Jan2022. Now they
  are no longer accepted in the ANALYZE statement.
- The ANALYZE statement can now be used in procedures, functions and triggers.

* Wed Apr 10 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Make schema renaming more permissive. A schema can be renamed if it
  does not contain objects that are a dependency for objects outside
  the schema. If such dependencies exist, they are shown in the
  table sys.dependencies.

* Tue Apr  8 2023 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Add a DECIMAL AS clause to COPY INTO that configures the decimal separator
  and thousands separator for decimals, temporal types and floats.

* Thu Mar 21 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Introduce IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM syntax. The syntax allows two values
  to be compared. The comparison always returns boolean FALSE or TRUE
  never NULL.

* Wed Mar  6 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- SQL2023 feature: Introduce UNIQUE NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT syntax which
  allows for NULLS to be treated as unique, i.e. a column with this
  contraint can have one NULL value at most.

- SQL2023 feature: Allow project and ORDER BY expressions on
  UNIQUE constrained columns when the primary key column is
  used in a GROUP BY expression.
