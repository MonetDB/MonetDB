- Improve casting to generic decimal type by choosing a better fit for
  precision and scale instead of defaulting to 18 and 3, respectively.

* Thu Oct 17 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- When for whatever reason the upgrade code produces an error, we now
  exit the server.  Before the server would limp on with what is basically
  a broken database.

* Thu Sep 26 2024 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Improved the violation message of CHECK constraints when violated. It
  now includes the schema name of the constraint and the check clause.

* Fri Aug 23 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Increase the buffer size used by hot snapshot from 64kiB to 1MiB,
  and make it configurable through setting 'hot_snapshot_buffer_size'.
  It must be a multiple of 512.
