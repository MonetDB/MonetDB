.SH NAME
merovingian \- the MonetDB Database Server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B merovingian
[database ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B merovingian
is the MonetDB Database Server daemon.  It is not meant to be used in
interactive environments, and hence has no help or version commands nor
flags.  The typical use of
.B merovingian
is to be started from a startup script, such as from
.I /etc/init.d/
on Linux systems or
.BR smf (5)
on Solaris systems, as part of a system startup.
.P
A
.B merovingian
instance manages one local cluster based on the dbfarm specified in the
.I /etc/monetdb5.conf
config file.  Within this local cluster
.B merovingian
takes care of starting up databases when necessary, and stopping them
either upon request via
.BR monetdb (1)
or when being shut down.  Client connections initially are made against
.B merovingian
which redirects or proxies the client to the appropriate database
process, started on the fly when necessary.
.P
When started,
.B merovingian
runs in the background, sending log messages to
.I /var/log/merovingian.log
, until being sent a stop, terminate or interrupt signal.  All arguments
given when starting
.B merovingian
are considered to be databases to be pre-started.  Pre-started databases
are started as part of the startup of
.B merovingian
, which means their startup is not delayed until the first client
requests for them.
.P
.B merovingian
uses a neighbour discovery scheme to detect other
.B merovingian
processes running in the local network.  Databases from those remote
instances are made available to a locally connecting client.  Remote
databases never override local databases, and their availability is
controlled by the remote
.B merovingian
process.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B merovingian
defaults to use the configuration file that was placed in the file
system during installation to control its behaviour.  If the environment
variable
.I MONETDB5CONF
is set,
.B merovingian
uses the value of this variable as configuration file to load.  In the
configuration file the following options can be specified.  Most are
typically to be found under the
.I Merovingian
section in the default configuration file.
.IP gdk_dbfarm
The value of this setting determines which local cluster
.B merovingian
will monitor.
.IP mero_msglog
.IP mero_errlog
When both options are unset,
.B merovingian
logs messages and errors to the stdout and stderr channels on the
caller's console.  By setting one or both of the
.B mero_msglog
and
.B mero_errlog
variables, one can specify messages and/or errors to be logged to a file
instead.  It is legitimate to have both
.B mero_msglog
and
.B mero_errlog
pointing to the same file.
.IP mero_pidfile
Location pointing to the pidfile used by
.B merovingian
to write the process id of the daemon process that was started in the
background.  This pid can be used to stop
.B merovingian
again by sending it a termination signal.
.IP mero_port
The port
.B merovingian
will open up and listen to connections for.  When unset, the default
port 50000 is used, which should be ok for most setups.
.IP mero_exittimeout
All database servers that were started by
.B merovingian
are shut down when
.B merovingian
is shut down.  This behaviour is desirable if the
.B merovingian
process is ran from a start script that represents the MonetDB Database
Server.  Setting the
.B mero_exittimeout
option to a positive
non-zero value, causes each started database server to be shut down by
.B merovingian
when it shuts down itself with a given time-out in seconds.  If the
time-out expires, the database server is killed using the SIGKILL
signal.  A time-out value of
.B 0
means that no attempt is made to shut down started database servers.  As
a result, database servers will remain active after
.B merovingian
has stopped.  This situation may yield in confusing scenarios, hence you
are strongly advised to set the
.B mero_exittimeout
option as to override the
.B 0
default.
.IP mero_doproxy
.B merovingian
has two ways in which it can "attach" a connecting client to the target
database.  The first method uses a redirect to the responsible mserver
process, the second method proxies the client to the mserver over
.B merovingian.
While the first is more efficient, it requires the connecting client
to be able to connect to the mserver.  In many settings this may be
undesirable or even impossible, since a wide range of open ports are
necessary for this.  In such case the proxy behaviour of
.B merovingian
is a good solution, which also allows a
.B merovingian
on the border of a network to serve requests to nodes in the local
(unreachable) network.
.IP mero_discoveryttl
Neighbour discovery allows
.B merovingian
to discover other running
.B merovingian
processes in the local network.
.B merovingian
publishes locally available databases to others periodically.  The
interval used here depends on the time-to-live of the databases before
they need to get refreshed.  The default is 10 minutes, which should
keep traffic in your network fairly low.  If you add and/or remove
databases often, you may want to use a low ttl.  The value of this
option is expressed in seconds.
.SH SIGNALS
.B merovingian
acts upon a number of signals as is common for a daemon.
.IP "SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT"
Any of these signals make
.B merovingian
enter the shutdown sequence.  This sequence involves cleanly shutting
down listener sockets, shutting down all started databases and finally
terminating itself.
.IP SIGHUP
When this signal is received by
.B merovingian
it will reopen the logfiles as pointed to by
.B mero_msglog
and
.B mero_errlog\.
When these two are unset or point to a file attached to a terminal,
.B merovingian
will not reopen the associated filedescriptor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B merovingian
returns exit code
.B 0
if it was able to successfully launch the background process.  When an
error occurs during startup that prevents
.B merovingian
from functioning properly, an exit code
.B 1
is returned.
