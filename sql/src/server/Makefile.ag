#  Some versions of flex & bison seem to generate code
#  that does not compile with `gcc -Wundef`;
#  we use GCC_BISON_CFLAGS to disable the respective warning as
#  locally as possible via "-Wno-undef"
#  (see also MonetDB4/src/monet/Makefile.ag, buildtools/conf/monet.m4,
#  pathfinder/modules/pftijah/Makefile.ag, amdb/src/lang/Makefile.ag).
#
#  (At least on Fedora Core 4,) bison 2.0 seems to generate code
#  that icc does not like; since the problem only occurs with
#  sql/src/server/sql_parser.mx & amdb/src/lang/parser.y,
#  we use ICC_BISON_CFLAGS
#  to disable the respective warning as locally as possible
#  via "-wd592" (#592: variable "." is used before its value is set)
#  (see also MonetDB/conf/monet.m4 & amdb/src/lang/Makefile.ag).
