RELEASE NOTES
MonetDB JDBC driver version 1.2 (Blunt+)
Fabian Groffen <Fabian.Groffen@cwi.nl>

Release date: 2005-05-24

This JDBC driver is designed for use with MonetDB, a main-memory
database.  For more information see http://monetdb.cwi.nl/.

Within the current implementation not all functionalities of the JDBC
interface are available.  It is believed, however, that this
implementation is rich enough to be suitable for a majority of
application settings.

Below a list of supported features can be found.  Please read this list
if you intend to use this driver.  If you feel some features are
missing, please let us know at our SourceForge feature request page:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=56967&atid=482471

Feel free to file bugs, when they appear, at our SourceForge bug page as
well.


Currently implemented:
  * java.sql.Driver interface
  * javax.sql.DataSource interface (not tested)
  * java.sql.Connection interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - createStatement with result set holdability
    - nativeSQL (there is no query parsing for JDBC escapes yet)
    - prepareCall (CallableStatement not supported)
    - prepareStatement with more than just an SQL prepare statement
    - getCatalog/setCatalog (there is no catalog management yet)
    - getHoldability/setHoldability (close/hold cursors over commit is
      not configurable)
    - isReadOnly/setReadOnly (updatable result sets are not supported at
      all)

    NOTE: be sure to check for warnings after setting concurrencies or
          isolation levels; MonetDB currently does not support anything
          else but completely serializable transactions.
  * java.sql.Statement interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - cancel/getQueryTimeout/setQueryTimeout (query execution cannot be
      terminated, once started)
    - execute with more than just an SQL query
    - executeUpdate with more than just an SQL query
    - getGeneratedKeys
    - getMaxFieldSize/setMaxFieldSize
    - getResultSetHoldability
    - setCursorName
    - setEscapeProcessing
  * java.sql.PreparedStatement interface
    There is now a native PreparedStatement implementation which uses
    the SQL back-end for real prepare functionality.  The old Java
    implementation has been kept available for people that have trouble
    with the native implementation.  Setting the property
    "native_prepared_statements" to false at the driver call (either
    using a property list, or in the connection url as attribute
    "native_prepared_statements=false") switches from the default native
    PreparedStatement to the Java implementation.
    The next features are not implemented:
    - getMetaData
    - getParameterMetaData (1)
    - setArray
    - setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, setUnicodeStream
    - setBlob, setClob
    - setBytes
    - getObject with more than just the index and the object
    - setRef, setURI
    1) getParameterMetaData is only in the Java implementation
       unavailable, the native implementation has this method
       implemented.
  * java.sql.ResultSet interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - getArray
    - getAsciiStream, getBinaryStream, getUnicodeStream, getCharacterStream
    - getBlob, getClob
    - getRef, getURL
    - all methods related to updatable result sets
    * java.sql.ResultSetMetaData interface
      The next features are not implemented:
      - isNullable (always returns "unknown")
      - getSchemaName
      - getPrecision
      - getScale
  * java.sql.DatabaseMetaData interface
  * java.sql.SavePoint interface

- The getObject methods currently ignore any given type map.
- Auto-commit behaviour is defined by the server which handles the
  auto-commit.  This is in general in line with the JDBC standard.
