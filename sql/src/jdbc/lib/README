In order to be able to compile the MonetDB XML:DB driver, this directory
needs to contain the xmldb jar-file, which cannot be included here by
default for licence issues.

In order to get the xmldb.jar file from the eXist project SF CVS server
type:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@exist.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/exist co -r1.3 eXist-1.0/lib/core/xmldb.jar
mv eXist-1.0/lib/core/xmldb.jar .
rm -R eXist-1.0
