- The sys.functions table now has an extra column called "system" of
  type BOOLEAN whose value is TRUE for system functions (i.e. functions
  that should not be dumped).  The table sys.systemfunctions has been
  changed to a view and is now officially deprecated.

- Extended merge tables with partitioning using a predicate:
  > CREATE MERGE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (... columns ...)
  [ PARTITION BY { RANGE | VALUES }
  { ON '(' column_name ')' | USING '(' expression ')' } ]
  The partitioning can occur by range or list of values using one of
  the table's columns or an expression. The domain of the partitioning
  scheme will be covered by each child table added with alter statements
  depending if the table is partitioned by range or list of values:
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION IN '(' expression [ ',' ... ] ')' [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION BETWEEN { RANGE MINVALUE | expression } AND
  { RANGE MAXVALUE | expression } [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION WITH NULL
  When updating a single partition range/list of values, the SET
  keyword should be used instead of ADD.
  INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements are possible on partitioned
  tables with corresponding validation on each partition domain.
  The system tables sys.table_partitions, sys.range_partitions and
  sys.value_partitions were added to store meta-information about
  each existing partition.
