# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Aug 24 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added ISO/IEC 9075-11 SQL/Schemata (SQL:2011) with SQL system views:
   information_schema.schemata
   information_schema.tables
   information_schema.views
   information_schema.columns
   information_schema.character_sets
   information_schema.check_constraints
   information_schema.table_constraints
   information_schema.referential_constraints
   information_schema.sequences

  Most views have been extended (after the standard columns) with MonetDB
  specific information columns such as schema_id, table_id, column_id, etc.
  This simplifies filtering and joins with system tables/views in sys schema
  when needed.

  Note: MonetDB does NOT support catalog qualifiers in object names, so all the
  CATALOG columns in these information_schema views will always return NULL.

* Mon Aug 21 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added support for generated column syntax:
   GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ...
  This allows the user to override the default generated sequence value
  during inserts.

* Fri Jul 7 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added SQL support for: <result offset clause> and <fetch first clause>
  in  <query expression> ::=
      [ <with clause> ] <query expression body>
      [ <order by clause> ]
      [ <result offset clause> ]
      [ <fetch first clause> ]
      [ <sample clause> ]

  <result offset clause> ::=
     OFFSET <offset row count> [ {ROW|ROWS} ]

  <fetch first clause> ::=
     FETCH {FIRST|NEXT} <fetch first row count> {ROW|ROWS} ONLY
