# ChangeLog file for sql

* Tue Jun  3 2025 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- It is now possible to change the type of a column by using a query
  like ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c type;.  The content of the column
  is converted to the new type using code similar to CAST(c AS type).
  If the conversion fails, the column type isn't changed.

* Wed Jun 25 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- With COPY INTO, the USING DELIMITERS, DECIMAL, ESCAPE, NULL, BEST EFFORT and
  FWF clauses can now be given in any order. If a clause occurs multiple times,
  the last instance wins.
