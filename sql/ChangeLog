- The sys.epoch function has always been confusing.  There are two
  versions, one with an INTEGER argument, and one with a BIGINT
  argument.  The former accepted values as seconds, whereas the
  latter epected milliseconds.  Also, the construct EXTRACT(EPOCH
  FROM value) returns a BIGINT with millisecond precision.  This has
  now been overhauled.  There is no longer a function sys.epoch with
  BIGINT argument, but instead there is a new function sys.epoch with
  DECIMAL(18,3) argument.  The argument is seconds, but with 3 decimals,
  it provides millisecond accuracy. Also the EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM value)
  now returns a DECIMAL(18,3), again seconds with 3 decimals giving
  millisecond accuracy.  Note that the internal, binary representation
  of DECIMAL(18,3) interpreted as seconds with 3 decimals and BIGINT
  with millisecond precision is exactly the same.
