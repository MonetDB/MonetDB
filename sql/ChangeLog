- Introduce the RETURNING clause for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
  Specifying a RETURNING clause causes the SQL statement to return the
  modified records which can be queried using SELECT like expressions
  in the RETURNING clause. Aggregate functions are allowed.
  This is a common non-standard SQL extension.
  
  Examples:
  
  INSERT INTO foo values (1,10), (-1,-10) RETURNING i+2*j AS bar
  ----
  21
  -21
  
  UPDATE foo SET i = -i WHERE i >0 RETURNING sum(j), count(j)
  ----
  -60|3

- Introduce division_min_scale SQL environment variable for specifying
  minimum scale of the division result. The default value is 3.
