# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- The TRACE prefix for SQL queries now no longer produces two result sets.
  Before, the first result set was the result of the query, and the
  second result set was timing information of the query execution.
  This second result set is no longer produced.  Instead, use the
  (already existing) function sys.tracelog() of view sys.tracelog to
  retrieve this information.  As before, the table that is produced by the
  function/view is reset whenever a new TRACE prefixed query is executed.

- Removed table returning function sys.optimizer_stats().

* Tue Aug 26 2025 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- There are new types "inet4" and "inet6" which can hold respecitvely
  IPv4 and IPv6 internet addresses without CIDR network mask
  information.  Netmask information can be held in a separate column if
  they are needed.  The 0 address (0.0.0.0 and ::) are used as NULL
  value and can therefore not be used as addresses.  Bitwise operations
  (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) are supported on the addresses, and there are
  various functions to check whether an address is contained in a
  (sub)net (where an extra CIDR netmask column is also needed).

- Added the possibility to specify IF NOT EXISTS for the following
  CREATE statements:

    CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS seq_name ...

    CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS user_name ...

    CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS role_name ...

    CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS type_name ...

    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index_name ON ...

    CREATE IMPRINTS INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index_name ON ...

    CREATE ORDERED INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index_name ON ...

  With IF NOT EXISTS specified these CREATE statements will not return
  an error when an object with the same name already exists.  See doc:
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-manual/data-definition/

- Added the possibility to specify IF EXISTS for the following DROP statements:

    DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS seq_name ...

    DROP USER IF EXISTS user_name

    DROP ROLE IF EXISTS role_name

    DROP TYPE IF EXISTS type_name ...

    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS index_name

  With IF EXISTS specified these statements will not return an error
  when the object does not exists.  See doc:
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-manual/data-definition/drop-statement/

- Added the possibility to specify IF EXISTS for two ALTER statements:

    ALTER SEQUENCE IF EXISTS seq_name ...

    ALTER USER IF EXISTS user_name ...

  With IF EXISTS specified these statements will not return an error
  when the object does not exists.  See doc:
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-manual/data-types/serial-types/
  and
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-manual/data-definition/privileges/

- It is now possible to change the type of a column by using a statement
  like ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c type;.  The content of the column
  is converted to the new type using code similar to CAST(c AS type).
  If the conversion fails, the column type isn't changed.

* Wed Jun 25 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- With COPY INTO, the USING DELIMITERS, DECIMAL, ESCAPE, NULL, BEST EFFORT and
  FWF clauses can now be given in any order. If a clause occurs multiple times,
  the last instance wins.
