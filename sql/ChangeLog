- Added JDBC/ODBC escape sequences implementation to SQL layer. Now all
  clients can forward them without further processing.

* Fri Sep 30 2022 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, apply default values instead of just
  inserting NULLs.
- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, validate DECIMAL(n,k) and
  VARCHAR(n) column width.
- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, string used to have their line
  endings converted from CR LF to LF. Do not do this, it is the responsibility
  of the client.
- Implement dumping binary data using COPY SELECT ... INTO BINARY <file>.

* Thu Aug 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed code for Workload Capture and Replace.  The code was
  experimental, and it didn't work out.  A different approach will
  be taken.
