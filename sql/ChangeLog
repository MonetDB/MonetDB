* Wed Apr 10 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Make schema renaming more permissive. A schema can be renamed if it
  does not contain objects that are a dependency for objects outside
  the schema. If such dependencies exist, they are shown in the
  table sys.dependencies.

* Tue Apr  8 2023 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Add a DECIMAL AS clause to COPY INTO that configures the decimal separator
  and thousands separator for decimals, temporal types and floats.

* Thu Mar 21 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Introduce IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM syntax. The syntax allows two values
  to be compared. The comparison always returns boolean FALSE or TRUE
  never NULL.

* Wed Mar  6 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- SQL2023 feature: Introduce UNIQUE NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT syntax which
  allows for NULLS to be treated as unique, i.e. a column with this
  contraint can have one NULL value at most.

- SQL2023 feature: Allow project and ORDER BY expressions on
  UNIQUE constrained columns when the primary key column is
  used in a GROUP BY expression.
