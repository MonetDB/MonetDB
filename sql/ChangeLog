  'finished'.

- SQL function sys.queue() overloaded with sys.queue(username string),
  SYSADMIN only, allowing to filter the global queue by username or
  use 'ALL' to retrive the global queue. Calling the function without
  arguments returns the current user queue.
- SQL procedures sys.pause(tag bigint), sys.resume(tag bigint),
  sys.stop(tag bigint) overloaded with sys.pause(tag bigint, username string),
  sys.resume(tag bigint, username string) and sys.stop(tag bigint, username
  string), SYSADMIN only, allowing to pause, resume and stop query
  executions by TAG,USERNAME. The call without arguments is a public
  procedure giving access to users to pause, resume and stop their
  own query executions.

* Wed Feb 15 2023 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added JDBC/ODBC escape sequences implementation to SQL layer. Now all
  clients can forward them without further processing.

- It is no longer allowed to create a merge table or remote table or
  replica table or unlogged table in schema "tmp". The tmp schema is
  reserved for temporary objects only, such as local/global temp tables.

* Thu Nov  3 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>

- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, apply default values instead of just
  inserting NULLs.
- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, validate DECIMAL(n,k) and
  VARCHAR(n) column width.
- When loading data using COPY BINARY INTO, string used to have their line
  endings converted from CR LF to LF. Do not do this, it is the responsibility
  of the client.
- Implement dumping binary data using COPY SELECT ... INTO BINARY <file>.

* Thu Aug 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed code for Workload Capture and Replace.  The code was
  experimental, and it didn't work out.  A different approach will
  be taken.
