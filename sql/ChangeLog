# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- Removed '@' syntax used to refer into a variable in a query. It
  was a non-standard method, which was replaced by a schema addition to
  variables. Variables in the global scope now have schema. All default
  global variables are set under schema "sys". However variables
  inside PSM don't have a schema, because there are no transaction
  semantics inside PSM at the moment.
- Removed declared variables and tables from the global scope. They were
  transaction agnostic and incompatible with the SQL standard, i.e. they
  are valid exclusively under PSM (e.g. functions, procedures and 
  triggers).
- Scoping semantics were added for both variables and tables. Variables
  with the same name at a query are now resolved under the following
  precedence rules:
    1. Tables, Views and CTEs at the FROM clause.
    2. Variable declared in the body of function/procedure, i.e. local
       variable.
    3. Function/procedure parameter.
    4. Variable from the global scope.
  Tables with the same name now have the following precedence rules at a
  SQL query: 
    1. Table declared in the body of function/procedure, ie local table.
    2. Temporary table.
    3. Table from the current session schema.
  This means the query: SELECT * FROM "keys"; will list keys from
  temporary tables instead of persisted ones, because "keys" table
  is available for both "sys" and "tmp" schemas.
- The table returning function "var" was extended with more details
  about globally declared variables, namely their schema, type and
  current value.
