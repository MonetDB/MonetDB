* Tue Jul 16 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: The "phash" column in the sys.storage() table now indicates whether a
  hash exists.  If the hash is not loaded but there is a hash available
  on disk, the phash value is "true", but the "hashes" value is 0.

* Thu Jul 11 2024 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Added execution privilege on all sys.generate_series(first, limit)
  and sys.generate_series(first, limit, stepsize) functions to public,
  so all users can now call these table producing generator functions.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- MonetDB: Removed upgrade code for versions before Jul2021.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- mapilib: Add new columns to sys.sessions. Column 'language' is usually 'sql'.
  Column 'peer' is the network address of the client (something like
  '[::1]:46558' or '<UNIX SOCKET>'). Columns 'hostname', 'application',
  'client', 'clientpid' and 'remark' can be set by the client.
  Libmapi/mclient, pymonetdb and monetdb-java have been modified to fill
  in sensible default values.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Extend CREATE USER MAX_MEMORY and ALTER USER MAX_MEMORY to accept
  strings of the form '10MiB', '10G', etc.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Extended view sys.sessions and function sys.sessions() with new columns:
  language, peer, hostname, application, client, clientpid and remark.
- sql: All users now have SELECT privilege on view sys.sessions, but non-admin
  users only see their own sessions.
- sql: Added procedure sys.setclientinfo(property string, value string)
  to allow the client application to set a specific client info property.
- sql: Added system table sys.clientinfo_properties that lists the supported
  client info properties and their associated column name in sys.sessions view.
  It contains property names: ClientHostname, ApplicationName,
  ClientLibrary, ClientPid and ClientRemark.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- odbc: ODBC now supports TLS. It can be configured through the following
  DSN- or Connection String attributes (canonical name / user friendly name):
    TLS / Encrypt = ON/OFF
    CERT / Server Certificate = PATH
    CERTHASH / Server Certificate Hash = sha256:HEXDIGITS
    CLIENTKEY / Client Key = PATH
    CLIENTCERT / Client Certificate = PATH
- odbc: Several more connection properties have been made configurable:
    SCHEMA / Schema = NAME
    TIMEZONE / Time Zone = Minutes East Of UTC
    REPLYSIZE / Reply Size = NUMBER
    LOGFILE / Log File = PATH
    LOGINTIMEOUT / Login Timeout = MILLISECONDS
    CONNECTIONTIMEOUT / Connection Timeout = MILLISECONDS
    AUTOCOMMIT / Autocommit = ON/OFF
    SOCK / Unix Socket = PATH (unix only)
- odbc: SQLBrowseConnect() adds On/Off suggestions to boolean settings
  and prioritizes the DATABASE attribute if it notices monetdbd
  requires one. Apart from that only UID/User and PWD/Password
  are required, all others have sensible defaults.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Extended sys.generate_series() to generate dates. Added 2 new functions:
  sys.generate_series(first date, "limit" date, stepsize interval month) and
  sys.generate_series(first date, "limit" date, stepsize interval day).

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Added support for select exp, count(*) group by 1 order by 1;
  ie. using numeric references in group by clause.
- sql: Added support for GROUP BY ALL. This finds all expressions from the
  selections which aren't aggregations and groups on those.
  At least one aggregation must be specified.
  The ALL keyword can also be replaced by '*', so: GROUP BY *.
- sql: Added support for ORDER BY ALL. This orders on all columns of the selection.
  The ALL keyword can also be replaced by '*', so: ORDER BY *.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- MonetDB: The shared library (.dll aka .so files) now have the version number
  as part of the name.  This should allow the building of compatibility
  versions that can be installed in parallel to the latest version.
- MonetDB: Some of the Debian/Ubuntu packages have been renamed.  The old monetdb5
  names have been changed to plain monetdb, and libmonetdb5-server-*
  packages have been renamed monetdb-*.
- MonetDB: The names of some of the provided RPM files have been changed.
  References to the old MonetDB5 name have been removed.  All packages
  are now just MonetDB.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- gdk: Various changes were made having to do with things like case-insensitive
  comparisons and converting to upper or lower case.  Case insensitive
  comparison (i.e. the ILIKE operator) uses case folding which is similar
  to converting to lower case, but changes more characters, also sometimes
  to multiple characters (e.g. German sharp s (ß) compares equal to SS).

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- stream: ICONV support has been removed from the stream library.  The server
  itself only needs UTF-8 support.  The client (mclient) does have
  iconv support.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Removed the obsolete ANALYZE statement syntax options: SAMPLE nn and
  MINMAX. Both options have been ignored since release Jan2022. Now they
  are no longer accepted in the ANALYZE statement.
- sql: The ANALYZE statement can now be used in procedures, functions and triggers.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Make schema renaming more permissive. A schema can be renamed if it
  does not contain objects that are a dependency for objects outside
  the schema. If such dependencies exist, they are shown in the
  table sys.dependencies.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- gdk: Made some changes to how BAT descriptors are allocated.  They are now
  allocated in bulk, meaning fewer malloc/free calls during processing.
- gdk: Removed macro BBP_cache and its associated code.  Checking whether a
  BAT is cached (loaded in memory) can be done by checking the BBPLOADED
  bit in the BBP_status value.  Getting a pointer to the BAT descriptor
  can be done by using BBP_desc.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Introduce IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM syntax. The syntax allows two values
  to be compared. The comparison always returns boolean FALSE or TRUE
  never NULL.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Yunus Koning <yunus.koning@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: SQL2023 feature: Introduce UNIQUE NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT syntax which
  allows for NULLS to be treated as unique, i.e. a column with this
  constraint can have one NULL value at most.
- sql: SQL2023 feature: Allow project and ORDER BY expressions on
  UNIQUE constrained columns when the primary key column is
  used in a GROUP BY expression.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- stream: CURL support has been removed from the stream library.  If support is
  needed, look at the source code in either streamcat.c or mclient.c.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- gdk: The SQL transaction ID is no longer saved in the BBP.dir file.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- clients: Msqldump now accepts --output and --outputdir options.  When the
  --outputdir option is used, the dump is placed in the file dump.sql in
  the specified directory and all tables are dumped to separate CSV files.
  In this way it is feasible to edit the dump script by hand if needed,
  even for a large database.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- clients: The --table (-t) option of msqldump now accepts SQL-style % wildcard
  characters to dump all tables that match the pattern.  E.g. -t
  %test%.%test% dumps all tables with 'test' in both the schema and
  table name.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- clients: Implemented interrupt handling in mclient.  When using mclient
  interactively, an interrupt (usually control-C) stops whatever the
  client is doing.  When editing a line, the line is discarded; when
  editing a second or later line of a query, the whole query is discarded;
  when a query is being executed, the server is asked to stop the query
  at its earliest convenience.  Stopping a running query can only be
  done with an up-to-date server.  All of this does not work on Windows.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- gdk: Made some changes to the TIMEOUT macros.  Most importantly, they
  now get a pointer to a QryCtx structure as argument instead of the
  timeout value.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- sql: Add a DECIMAL AS clause to COPY INTO that configures the decimal separator
  and thousands separator for decimals, temporal types and floats.

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.11-20240629

* Sat Jun 29 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.11-20240629
- monetdb5: The mserver5 program has a new option: --without-geom.  If the server
  was compiled with geom support (or the geom module was installed in a
  binary distribution), this option allows the server to start without
  the geom module, so that it can proceed with a database that was
  created without geom.

* Wed May 15 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.11-20240629
- sql: When sys.persist_unlogged is called for a table, it may return that
  zero rows were persisted.  If this is because the call was done too
  early, i.e. the table was recently created and the write-ahead log
  where this was logged has not been processed yet, the call will
  request an immediate write-ahead log rotation.  This means that the
  WAL will be processed as soon as possible and a new call to
  sys.persist_unlogged soon after will likely return a positive result.

* Thu May 02 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.9-20240502

* Thu Mar 28 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- gdk: Threads have their own list of free bats.  The list was not returned
  to the system when a thread exited, meaning that the free bats that
  were in the list would not be reused by any thread.  This has been
  fixed.

* Tue Mar 19 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- monetdb5: Fixed interaction between mserver5 and remote mserver5 when only one
  of the two has 128 bit integer support.

* Tue Mar 19 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- sql: Fixed issue where equal column aliases were created. When those
  aliases were parsed on the remote side it could give crashes.

* Mon Mar 18 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- gdk: Fixed a couple of deadlock situations, one actually observed, one
  never observed.

* Tue Mar 12 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.5-20240312

* Fri Mar  8 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.5-20240312
- gdk: The internal hash function for floating point types has been changed.
  It is now no longer based on the bit representation, but on the value,
  meaning that +0 and -0 (yes, they both exist in floating point) now
  hash to the same value.

* Thu Mar  7 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.5-20240312
- sql: performance improvement of 'startswith' and 'endswith' filter functions
  for join operators

* Wed Mar  6 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.5-20240312
- clients: Fixed an issue where mclient wouldn't exit if the server it had
  connected to exited for whatever reason while the client was waiting
  for a query result.

* Mon Mar 04 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304

* Fri Mar  1 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304
- gdk: Fixed a regression where bats weren't always cleaned up when they
  weren't needed anymore.  In particular, after a DELETE FROM table query
  without a WHERE clause (which deletes all rows from the table), the
  bats for the table get replaced by new ones, and the old, now unused,
  bats weren't removed from the database.

- GH#7413: MonetDB server crashes in `BATcalcbetween_intern`

* Tue Dec 19 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions bat.reuse and bat.reuseMap.

* Tue Dec 12 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Introduced options wal_max_dropped, wal_max_file_age and
  wal_max_file_size that control the write-ahead log file rotation.

* Wed Dec  6 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: The MAL functions io.import and io.export have been removed.

* Tue Dec  5 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Introduction of table returning function `persist_unlogged(schema
  string, table string)` that attempts to persist data in disk if
  "schema"."table" is unlogged table in insert only mode.  If persist
  attempt is successful, the count of the persisted rows is returned,
  otherwise the count is 0.

* Fri Dec  1 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: All binary packages are now signed with a new key with key fingerprint
  DBCE 5625 94D7 1959 7B54  CE85 3F1A D47F 5521 A603.

* Thu Nov 30 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- odbc: Corrected the output value of column CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH of ODBC functions
  SQLColumns() and SQLProcedureColumns().

* Thu Nov 23 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- geom: Because recent changes to the geom module require the use of geos
  3.10, the geom module is no longer available in older versions of
  Debian and Ubuntu.  Specifically, Debian 10 and 11 (buster and
  bullseye) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) are affected.  There is no
  automatic upgrade available for databases that were geom enabled to
  databases that are not, so dump + restore is the only option (if no
  geom types are actually used).

* Thu Nov 23 2023 stefanos mavros <stemavros@gmail.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- geom: Implements Rtree index in GDK layer based on librtree. The index is
  used in the implementation of the filter functions ST_Intersects and
  ST_Dwithin for geometric points.
- geom: Improves shapefile support by replacing functions SHPattach,
  SHPpartialimport, ahd SHPimport with SHPload.
- geom: Introduces functions ST_DistanceGeographic, ST_DwithinGeographic,
  ST_IntersectsGeographic, ST_CoversGeographic, ST_Collects with geodesic
  semantics. ST_Transform can be used to convert geodetic into geographic
  data using libPROJ.

* Tue Nov 21 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Fixed a (rare) race condition between copying a bat (COLcopy) and
  updates happening in parallel to that same bat.  This may only be
  an actual problem with string bats, and then only in very particular
  circumstances.

* Mon Nov 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Removed function BATroles to set column names on BATs.

* Mon Nov 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions bat.getRole and bat.setColumn since the
  underlying function BATroles was removed.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Removed the compiled-in limit on the number of threads that can be used.
  The number of threads are still limited, but the limit is dictated
  solely by the operating system and the availability of enough memory.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: The ranges of merge partitions are now pushed down into the low
  level GDK operations, giving them a handle to sometimes execute more
  efficiently.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Change how json is stored in the database: We now normalize json
  strings after parsing, removing whitespace and eliminating duplicate
  keys in objects.
- monetdb5: The function json.filter now properly returns json scalars instead of
  wrapping them in an array.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: We now prevent accidental upgrades from a database without 128 bit
  integers to one with 128 bit integers (also known as HUGEINT) from
  happening.  Upgrades will only be done if the server is started with
  the option --set allow_hge_upgrade=yes.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Removed the MAL tokenizer module.  It was never usable from SQL and
  in this form never would be.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added ISO/IEC 9075-11 SQL/Schemata (SQL:2011) with SQL system views:
   information_schema.schemata
   information_schema.tables
   information_schema.views
   information_schema.columns
   information_schema.character_sets
   information_schema.check_constraints
   information_schema.table_constraints
   information_schema.referential_constraints
   information_schema.routines
   information_schema.parameters
   information_schema.sequences
  For details see
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-catalog/information_schema/
  Most views have been extended (after the standard columns) with MonetDB
  specific information columns such as schema_id, table_id, column_id, etc.
  This simplifies filtering and joins with system tables/views in sys schema
  when needed.
  Note: MonetDB does NOT support catalog qualifiers in object names, so all the
  CATALOG columns in these information_schema views will always return NULL.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added support for generated column syntax:
   GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ...
  This allows the user to override the default generated sequence value
  during inserts.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: Removed the PYTHON MAP external language option, as after a fork the
  synchronization primitives could be in any state, leading to deadlocks.
  During the upgrade function definitions will fallback to the normal
  PYTHON language option.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: Implemented direct masking for strimp construction. The strimps
  datastructure now keeps an array of 65K 64-bit integers that is zero
  everywhere except at the indexes that correspond to header pairs. The
  entry for the nth pair in order has the nth bit of the bitstring
  on. These can be used to quickly construct bitstrings.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added SQL support for: <result offset clause> and <fetch first clause>
  in  <query expression> ::=
      [ <with clause> ] <query expression body>
      [ <order by clause> ]
      [ <result offset clause> ]
      [ <fetch first clause> ]
      [ <sample clause> ]
  <result offset clause> ::=
     OFFSET <offset row count> [ {ROW|ROWS} ]
  <fetch first clause> ::=
     FETCH {FIRST|NEXT} <fetch first row count> {ROW|ROWS} ONLY
