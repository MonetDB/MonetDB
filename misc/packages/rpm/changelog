* Thu Mar 28 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- gdk: Threads have their own list of free bats.  The list was not returned
  to the system when a thread exited, meaning that the free bats that
  were in the list would not be reused by any thread.  This has been
  fixed.

* Tue Mar 19 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- monetdb5: Fixed interaction between mserver5 and remote mserver5 when only one
  of the two has 128 bit integer support.

* Tue Mar 19 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- sql: Fixed issue where equal column aliases were created. When those
  aliases were parsed on the remote side it could give crashes.

* Mon Mar 18 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.7-20240409
- gdk: Fixed a couple of deadlock situations, one actually observed, one
  never observed.

* Fri Mar  8 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.5-20240312
- gdk: The internal hash function for floating point types has been changed.
  It is now no longer based on the bit representation, but on the value,
  meaning that +0 and -0 (yes, they both exist in floating point) now
  hash to the same value.

* Thu Mar  7 2024 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.5-20240312

* Wed Mar  6 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.5-20240312
- clients: Fixed an issue where mclient wouldn't exit if the server it had
  connected to exited for whatever reason while the client was waiting
  for a query result.

* Mon Mar 04 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304

* Fri Mar  1 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304
- gdk: Fixed a regression where bats weren't always cleaned up when they
  weren't needed anymore.  In particular, after a DELETE FROM table query
  without a WHERE clause (which deletes all rows from the table), the
  bats for the table get replaced by new ones, and the old, now unused,
  bats weren't removed from the database.

* Mon Jan 15 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304
- geom: We switched over to using the reentrant interface of the geos library.
  This fixed a number of bugs that would occur sporadically.

* Mon Jan 15 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304
- sql: The function json.isvalid(json) incorrectly returned true if the
  argument was null.  It should return null.

- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions bat.reuse and bat.reuseMap.

* Tue Dec 12 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Introduced options wal_max_dropped, wal_max_file_age and
  wal_max_file_size that control the write-ahead log file rotation.

* Wed Dec  6 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: The MAL functions io.import and io.export have been removed.

* Tue Dec  5 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Introduction of table returning function `persist_unlogged(schema
  string, table string)` that attempts to persist data in disk if
  "schema"."table" is unlogged table in insert only mode.  If persist
  attempt is successful, the count of the persisted rows is returned,
  otherwise the count is 0.

* Fri Dec  1 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: All binary packages are now signed with a new key with key fingerprint

* Thu Nov 30 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- odbc: Corrected the output value of column CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH of ODBC functions
  SQLColumns() and SQLProcedureColumns().

* Thu Nov 23 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- geom: Because recent changes to the geom module require the use of geos
  3.10, the geom module is no longer available in older versions of
  Debian and Ubuntu.  Specifically, Debian 10 and 11 (buster and
  bullseye) and Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) are affected.  There is no
  automatic upgrade available for databases that were geom enabled to
  databases that are not, so dump + restore is the only option (if no
  geom types are actually used).

* Thu Nov 23 2023 stefanos mavros <stemavros@gmail.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- geom: Implements Rtree index in GDK layer based on librtree. The index is
  used in the implementation of the filter functions ST_Intersects and
  ST_Dwithin for geometric points.
- geom: Improves shapefile support by replacing functions SHPattach,
  SHPpartialimport, ahd SHPimport with SHPload.
- geom: Introduces functions ST_DistanceGeographic, ST_DwithinGeographic,
  ST_IntersectsGeographic, ST_CoversGeographic, ST_Collects with geodesic
  semantics. ST_Transform can be used to convert geodetic into geographic
  data using libPROJ.

* Tue Nov 21 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Fixed a (rare) race condition between copying a bat (COLcopy) and
  updates happening in parallel to that same bat.  This may only be
  an actual problem with string bats, and then only in very particular
  circumstances.

* Mon Nov 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Removed function BATroles to set column names on BATs.

* Mon Nov 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions bat.getRole and bat.setColumn since the
  underlying function BATroles was removed.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: Removed the compiled-in limit on the number of threads that can be used.
  The number of threads are still limited, but the limit is dictated
  solely by the operating system and the availability of enough memory.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: The ranges of merge partitions are now pushed down into the low
  level GDK operations, giving them a handle to sometimes execute more
  efficiently.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Change how json is stored in the database: We now normalize json
  strings after parsing, removing whitespace and eliminating duplicate
  keys in objects.
- monetdb5: The function json.filter now properly returns json scalars instead of
  wrapping them in an array.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- gdk: We now prevent accidental upgrades from a database without 128 bit
  integers to one with 128 bit integers (also known as HUGEINT) from
  happening.  Upgrades will only be done if the server is started with
  the option --set allow_hge_upgrade=yes.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- monetdb5: Removed the MAL tokenizer module.  It was never usable from SQL and
  in this form never would be.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added ISO/IEC 9075-11 SQL/Schemata (SQL:2011) with SQL system views:
   information_schema.schemata
   information_schema.tables
   information_schema.views
   information_schema.columns
   information_schema.character_sets
   information_schema.check_constraints
   information_schema.table_constraints
   information_schema.referential_constraints
   information_schema.routines
   information_schema.parameters
   information_schema.sequences
  For details see
  https://www.monetdb.org/documentation/user-guide/sql-catalog/information_schema/
  Most views have been extended (after the standard columns) with MonetDB
  specific information columns such as schema_id, table_id, column_id, etc.
  This simplifies filtering and joins with system tables/views in sys schema
  when needed.
  Note: MonetDB does NOT support catalog qualifiers in object names, so all the
  CATALOG columns in these information_schema views will always return NULL.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added support for generated column syntax:
   GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ...
  This allows the user to override the default generated sequence value
  during inserts.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: Removed the PYTHON MAP external language option, as after a fork the
  synchronization primitives could be in any state, leading to deadlocks.
  During the upgrade function definitions will fallback to the normal
  PYTHON language option.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- MonetDB: Implemented direct masking for strimp construction. The strimps
  datastructure now keeps an array of 65K 64-bit integers that is zero
  everywhere except at the indexes that correspond to header pairs. The
  entry for the nth pair in order has the nth bit of the bitstring
  on. These can be used to quickly construct bitstrings.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Niels Nes <niels.nes@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- sql: Added SQL support for: <result offset clause> and <fetch first clause>
  in  <query expression> ::=
      [ <with clause> ] <query expression body>
      [ <order by clause> ]
      [ <result offset clause> ]
      [ <fetch first clause> ]
      [ <sample clause> ]
  <result offset clause> ::=
     OFFSET <offset row count> [ {ROW|ROWS} ]
  <fetch first clause> ::=
     FETCH {FIRST|NEXT} <fetch first row count> {ROW|ROWS} ONLY

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.17-20231116
- Rebuilt.

* Thu Nov 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.17-20231116
- gdk: Fixed a regression where after a while the write-ahead log files
  weren't being rotated, meaning from some point onwards, the newest
  file just kept on growing.

* Thu Nov 09 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.15-20231109
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7410: SIGSEGV cause database corruption

* Tue Nov  7 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.15-20231109
- gdk: When saving the SQL catalog during a low-level commit, we should
  only save the part of the catalog that corresponds to the part of the
  write-ahead log that has been processed.  What we did was save more,
  which resulted in the catalog containing references to tables and
  columns whose disk presence is otherwise only in the write-ahead log.

* Fri Nov 03 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.13-20231103
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7300: Implement missing standard SQL DATE and TIMESTAMP functions
- GH#7324: string_distance('method',str1, str2) as a generic distance
  function
- GH#7409: Numpy table returning UDFs with variadic arguments

* Thu Nov  2 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.13-20231103
- sql: Added a missing interface function sys.timestamp_to_str with
  a TIMESTAMP (as opposed to TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) argument.
  The missing interface caused error messages being produced when the
  function was called with a TIMESTAMP argument, although it did give
  the correct result.

* Tue Oct 31 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.13-20231103
- gdk: A bug was fixed where the administration of which bats were in use was
  interpreted incorrectly during startup, causing problems later.  One
  symptom that has been observed was failure to startup with a message
  that the catalog tables could not be loaded.

* Fri Sep 29 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.11-20230929
- Rebuilt.

* Fri Sep 29 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.11-20230929
- MonetDB: Fixed an installation issue on Debian and Ubuntu introduced in the
  last build.

* Wed Sep 27 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.9-20230927
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7402: Privileges on merge table not propagated to partition tables

* Mon Sep 25 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7094: Drop remote tables in transactions and rollback
- GH#7303: Improve the performance of multi-column filters
- GH#7400: VM max memory is not check correctly for cgroups v2
- GH#7401: Column aliases used incorrectly in UNION subqueries

* Fri Sep 22 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- gdk: Fixed a number of data races (race conditions).

* Mon Sep 18 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- gdk: Fixed a reference counting problem when a BAT could nog be loaded,
  e.g. because of resource limitations.

* Wed Aug 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- gdk: Only check for virtual memory limits when creating or growing bats,
  not for general memory allocations.  There is (still) too much code
  that doesn't properly handle failing allocations, so we need to avoid
  those as much as possible.  This has mostly an effect if there are
  virtual memory size restrictions imposed by cgroups (memory.swap.max
  in cgroups v2, memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes in cgroups v1).
- gdk: The low-level commit turned out to always commit every persistent bat
  in the system.  There is no need for that, it should only commit bats
  that were changed.  This has now been fixed.
- gdk: Implemented timeout/exit checks in a bunch more operators.  Long(er)
  running operators occasionally check whether they're taking too long
  (past a user-specified timeout) or whether the server is exiting.
  This is now done in more places.

* Wed Aug 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- MonetDB: Do a lot more error checking, mostly for allocation failures.  More is
  still needed, though.

* Thu Aug 10 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.7-20230925
- MonetDB: Improve performance of the ILIKE operator when the pattern contains only
  ASCII characters. In this case we do not need to treat any characters as
  UTF-8 and we can use much faster routines that perform byte comparisons.

* Tue Jul 18 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.5-20230718
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7388: Query results in large cross product

  (163840000)

* Thu Jun 22 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.5-20230718
- sql: An upgrade that both creates a new .snapshot user and extends the
  sys.db_user_info table with (among others) a password column did
  these in such a way that the passord value for the new user was NULL.
  This is fixed by updating the password.

* Thu Jun 22 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.5-20230718
- monetdb5: There is now a new option --set tablet_threads=N to limit the number
  of threads used for a COPY INTO from CSV file query.  This option can
  also be set for a specific database using the monetdb command using
  the ncopyintothreads property.

* Thu Jun 22 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.3-20230622

- clients: The COPY INTO from file ON CLIENT was extended to also look for a
  relative path name relative to the file from which the query was read.
  This is only possible if the name of the query file is known, so when
  it is specified on the command line or read using the interactive
  \< command.

  be removed in the next release.

* Tue Jun  6 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.1-20230616
- odbc: Extended Windows MonetDB ODBC Data Source setup program with option
  to specify a logfile to enable tracing of ODBC Driver API calls.
  On other platforms users can edit the  odbc.ini  file and add a line:
  logfile=/home/username/odbctrace.log
  When a logfile is specified it will start logging the ODBC Driver API calls
  to the logfile after a new connection is made via SQLConnect() or
  SQLDriverConnect() or SQLBrowseConnect().
  Note that enabling ODBC logging will slow down the performance of ODBC
  applications, so enable it only for analysing ODBC Driver problems.

* Tue Jun  6 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.1-20230616
- sql: New functionality for string matching and similarity: startswith,
  endswith, contains, Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler similarity.
  The functions startswith, endswith and contains have a version where
  a case insentive flag can be used.
  Also, there are new custom join functionality for startswith, endswith,
  contains, Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler similarity.
- sql: Renamed previous Levenshtein distance to Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
- sql: New string function that transform from UTF-8 encoding to Ascii called
  asciify.

* Tue Jun  6 2023 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.1-20230616
- odbc: Enhanced SQLTables() by adding support for table type names: 'BASE TABLE',
  'GLOBAL TEMPORARY' and 'LOCAL TEMPORARY' in parameter TableType. These are
  synonyms of: 'TABLE', 'GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE' and 'LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE'.

* Tue Jun  6 2023 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.1-20230616
