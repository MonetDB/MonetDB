* Tue Jun 06 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.17-20230606
- Rebuilt.

* Tue Jun  6 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.17-20230606
- sql: Fixed a regression introduced in the previous build: when a table is
  dropped in the same transaction where it was created, the data wasn't
  removed from disk.

* Tue May 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7360: Aggregates returning string crash
- GH#7361: Table data is lost on DB restart, but only when a table has
  2147483647 or more rows.

* Tue May 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: Warnings and informational messages are now sent to stdout instead of
  stderr, which means that monetdbd will now log them with the tag MSG
  instead of ERR.

* Tue Apr 25 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: Fixed parsing of the BBP.dir file when BAT ids grow larger than 2**24
  (i.e. 100000000 in octal).

* Thu Apr 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: Fixed yet another occurrence of a missing .tailN file.  This one could
  happen if a string bat was appended to in stages so that between appends
  the column was committed.  If an append caused both a realloc of the
  tail heap because it was getting longer and a realloc because it got
  wider, the file might get removed before the GDK level commit happened.

* Mon Apr 17 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- clients: If the number of rows in mclient is set to 0 (using either --rows=0
  option or \r0 on the mclient command line), the internal pager is used
  and it then uses the height of the terminal window.

* Wed Apr  5 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- sql: When creating a hot snapshot, allow other clients to proceed, even
  with updating queries.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: When processing the WAL, if a to-be-destroyed object cannot be found,
  don't stop, but keep processing the rest of the WAL.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- monetdb5: Client connections are cleaned up better so that we get fewer instances
  of clients that cannot connect.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- sql: Increased the size of a variable counting the number of changes made
  to the database (e.g. in case more than 2 billion rows are added to
  a table).
- sql: Improved cleanup after failures such as failed memory allocations.

* Mon Feb 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: A race condition was fixed where certain write-ahead log messages
  could get intermingled, resulting in a corrupted WAL file.
- gdk: If opening of a file failed when it was supposed to get memory mapped,
  an incorrect value was returned to indicate the failure, causing
  crashes later on.  This has been fixed.

* Thu Feb 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: A race condition was fixed that could result in a missing tail file
  for a string bat (i.e. a file with .tail1, .tail2, or .tail4 extension).

* Mon Feb 13 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- gdk: When saving a bat failed for some reason during a low-level commit,
  this was logged in the log file, but the error was then subsequently
  ignored, possibly leading to files that are too short or even missing.
- gdk: The write-ahead log (WAL) is now rotated a bit more efficiently by
  doing multiple log files in one go (i.e. in one low-level transaction).

* Mon Feb 13 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.15-20230530
- sql: An insert into a table from which a column was dropped in a parallel
  transaction was incorrectly not flagged as a transaction conflict.

* Thu Jan 26 2023 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.15-20230530
- sql: Fix bug where boolean NULLs were not recognized by COPY BINARY INTO

* Tue Jan 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7343: GDKmmap requesting 0 virtual memory
- GH#7347: A bug where an exception occurs even though it is a query with
  normal syntax (Merge Table)

* Mon Jan 23 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- sql: Fixed a regression where when there are multiple concurrent
  transactions, the dependencies weren't checked properly.

* Mon Jan 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- gdk: Fixed a race condition that could lead to a bat being added to the SQL
  catalog but nog being made persistent, causing a subsequent restart
  of the system to fail (and crash).

* Wed Jan  4 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- odbc: A crash in the ODBC driver was fixed when certain unsupported functions
  where used in a {fn ...} escape.

* Wed Dec 21 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- odbc: Prepare of a query where the sum of the number of parameters (question
  marks in the query) and the number of output columns is larger than
  100 could fail with an unexpected error.  This has been fixed.

* Fri Dec 16 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- sql: Added some error checking to prevent crashes.  Errors would mainly
  occur under memory pressure.

* Wed Dec 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- gdk: Fixed a race condition where a hash could have been created on a
  bat using the old bat count while in another thread the bat count
  got updated.  This would make the hash be based on too small a size,
  causing failures later on.

* Wed Dec 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- sql: Fixed cleanup after a failed allocation where the data being cleaned
  up was unitialized but still used as pointers to memory that also had
  to be freed.

* Thu Dec  8 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- gdk: When extending a bat failed, the capacity had been updated already and
  was therefore too large.  This could then later cause a crash.  This has
  been fixed by only updating the capacity if the extend succeeded.

* Wed Dec  7 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- sql: Fixed a double cleanup after a failed allocation in COPY INTO.  The
  double cleanup could cause a crash due to a race condition it enabled.

* Mon Dec 05 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.11-20221205
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7342: column which datatype is double couldn't group or aggregation
  in version 11.45.7

* Mon Nov 28 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128

- GH#7339: MonetDB corrupted state after SIGKILL

* Wed Nov  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- clients: Also dump the new options of CREATE USER.

* Wed Nov  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- gdk: On Windows, use the wide-character interface of system calls when
  dealing with the environment (i.e. file names and getenv()).
- gdk: Memory leaks have been fixed.
- gdk: Improved maintenance of the estimated number of distinct values in BATs.
  The estimate helps in deciding which low-level algorithm to use.

* Wed Nov  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- monetdb5: Fixed a crash when the server runs out of client contexts (i.e. more
  concurrent clients than the server is configured to handle).
- monetdb5: A race condition in the SHA hash code was fixed which resulted in
  occasional failed connection attempts when they occurred concurrently.

* Wed Nov  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- sql: Improved the handling of the "idle" value in the sys.sessions function
  and view.

* Wed Oct 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- monetdb5: Fix a bug where the MAL optimizer would use the starttime of the
  previous query to determine whether a query timeout occurred.

* Thu Oct 13 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.9-20221128
- odbc: Fixed issue with generated raw strings prefix when ODBC driver is used
  against a server older than Jun2020 (11.37).

* Wed Oct 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- merovingian: Stop logging references to monetdbd's logfile in said logfile.

* Mon Oct 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.9-20221128
- gdk: Offset heaps (.tailN files) were growing too fast and unnecessarily
  under certain conditions.  This has been fixed.  Also, when such too
  large files are now loaded into the system, it is recognized they are
  too large and they are truncated to a more reasonable size.

  function (and procedure) arguments.

* Wed Sep 21 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.3-20220921
- sql: The function sys.tracelog is now executable by anyone.  The function
  (and view of the same name) returns the tracing information of a query
  that was prepended with the TRACE keyword.

* Mon Sep 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.3-20220921
- gdk: Fixed a bug in ORDER BY with both NULLS LAST and LIMIT when the ordering
  was on an interger or integer-like column and NULL values are present.

* Mon Sep 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.3-20220921
- sql: Fixed a bug in COPY BINARY INTO where the input wasn't checked
  thoroughly enough.

* Tue Sep 13 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.3-20220921
- gdk: The median_avg and quantile_avg returned bogus results in the
  non-grouped case (i.e. something like SELECT sys.median_avg(i) FROM t).

* Tue Sep 13 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Rebuilt.

* Thu Sep  1 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Improved SQLSetPos(). It now allows RowNumber to be 0 when Operation
  is SQL_POSITION.

* Fri Aug 26 2022 Lucas Pereira <lucas.pereira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: Extended the built-in profiler to emit non-MAL events related to query
  compilation, optimization, transactions and client connections. To
  minimize, simplify and optimize the process of generating and processing
  profiler output, only the events marking the end of an operation are
  emitted in most cases and the emitted json messages themselves are
  trimmed down to their essential fields. Furthermore, the MAL instruction
  profiler.openstream now requires an integer as a single argument, "0" for
  default behaviour or "4" to turn on the profiler in minimal mode,
  which causes it to only emit general events and excludes individual MAL
  instruction execution events from the profiler streams.
  The MAL instruction profiler.openstream with zero arguments is deprecated.

* Thu Aug 25 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: Extended system view sys.users with columns: schema_path, max_memory,
  max_workers, optimizer and default_role.
  Extended system table sys.db_user_info with columns: schema_path,
  max_memory, max_workers, optimizer, default_role and password.
  The password is encrypted. This table can only be queried when the
  user has been granted the select privilege from monetdb.

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: The median_avg and quantile_avg returned bogus results in the
  non-grouped case (i.e. something like SELECT sys.median_avg(i) FROM t).

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- merovingian: In certain cases (when an mserver5 process exits right after producing
  a message) the log message was logged over and over again, causing
  monetdbd to use 100% CPU.  This has been fixed.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: CREATE USER statement has been extended to take more optional arguments
  like MAX_MEMORY, MAX_WORKERS, OPTIMIZER, DEFAULT ROLE. ALTER USER statement
  has also been extended with DEFAULT ROLE.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: A new function sys.url_extract_host(string, bool) which returns the
  host name from the given URL has been implemented.  The bool argument,
  if true, causes the www. prefix to be removed.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: The abort_on_error parameter of all GDK-level functions has been removed.
  Errors (e.g. overflow) now also results in an error.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: The user authentication tables are now administered by the SQL layer
  instead of the MAL layer.  This means that changing (adding, dropping,
  altering) user and role information is now transaction-safe.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Improved ODBC Error/Warning messages. They now include the name of the
  Data Source as required by the ODBC specification:
  [MonetDB][ODBC driver VERSION][data-source-name] data-source-supplied-text

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Improved MonetDB ODBC Data Source Configuration dialog on MS Windows by
  hiding the typed in password text. It now shows dots for the characters.
  This fixes request  https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB/issues/7314

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Changed output of TABLE_CAT or PROCEDURE_CAT result columns as returned
  by ODBC functions: SQLTables(), SQLColumns(), SQLPrimaryKeys(),
  SQLForeignKeys(), SQLStatistics(), SQLTablePrivileges(),
  SQLColumnPrivileges(), SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns().
  They used to return the static database name but now they will return
  NULL as MonetDB does not support CATALOG objects or qualifiers.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Removed the possibility to retrieve or set the CURRENT_CATALOG
  via SQLGetConnectAttr(hdbc, SQL_ATTR_CURRENT_CATALOG, ...) and
  SQLSetConnectAttr(hdbc, SQL_ATTR_CURRENT_CATALOG, ...) as MonetDB does
  not support CATALOG objects (no SQL support for: CREATE CATALOG abc
  or SET CATALOG abc) and therefore there is no CURRENT_CATALOG.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: Implemented BC/AD (and BCE/CE) suffixes when parsing dates.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Corrected ODBC functions SQLTablePrivileges() and SQLColumnPrivileges()
  for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did not return
  any rows when the temporary table had privileges set. Now they do return
  rows as expected.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Improved SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns(). They now list
  information also for all built-in system procedures and functions, not
  only those created via SQL. Also corrected the value of ORDINAL_POSITION
  for scalar function arguments. It would start at 2 instead of 1.
- odbc: Extended output of SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns() resultsets
  with an extra column SPECIFIC_NAME. This column contains the name which
  uniquely identifies this procedure or function within its schema. As
  MonetDB supports overloaded procedures and functions, the combination of
  PROCEDURE_SCHEM and PROCEDURE_NAME is not enough to uniquely identify
  a procedure or function. This extra column allows you to correctly
  match the corresponding rows returned by SQLProcedureColumns() with the
  specific rows of SQLProcedures(). This extra column SPECIFIC_NAME is
  implemented similar to the JDBC DatabaseMetaData methods getProcedures()
  and getProcedureColumns().

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: For SQLForeignKeys() corrected the output of columns UPDATE_RULE and
  DELETE_RULE. These columns used to always return 3 (= SQL_NO_ACTION)
  but now they will report the action codes as specified in the FOREIGN KEY
  CONSTRAINT construction.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Fixed issue in function SQLProcedureColumns(). When the argument ColumnName
  was not empty it generated an invalid SQL query which failed with error:
   SELECT: no such column 'c.name'. This has been resolved.
- odbc: Corrected implementation of SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_MAX_DRIVER_CONNECTIONS, ...).
  It used to always return 64. Now it returns the value from the MonetDB server.
- odbc: Changed the column names case of the result sets as returned by
  SQLTables(), SQLColumns(), SQLSpecialColumns(), SQLPrimaryKeys(),
  SQLForeignKeys(), SQLStatistics(), SQLTablePrivileges(),
  SQLColumnPrivileges(), SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns(). The
  column names where all in lowercase but the ODBC specification defines
  them in uppercase, so changed them to uppercase.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: The interface for using strimps has not changed (create an imprint index
  on a column of a read only table), but now construction happens at the
  beginning of the first query that uses the strimp and is performed in
  a multithreaded manner.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Corrected SQLSpecialColumns(..., SQL_BEST_ROWID, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary key. Now it also returns
  rows when a table has a unique constraint.
- odbc: Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_INDEX_ALL, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary or unique key. Now it also
  returns rows for indices which are not based on a key.
- odbc: Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_ENSURE). It now returns CARDINALITY
  information for columns based on a primary/unique key. Previously it
  always returned NULL for the CARDINALITY result column.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: Implemented the use of strimps for NOT LIKE queries. The idea is to
  run the corresponding LIKE query using strimps and take the complement
  of the result. We keep around NULL values both during strimp filtering
  and during the pcre part of the LIKE query so that they get discarded
  automatically when we take the complement.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- monetdb5: Disabled volcano pipeline due to known issues.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- odbc: Corrected ODBC functions SQLPrimaryKeys(), SQLSpecialColumns() and
  SQLStatistics() for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did
  not return any rows when the temp table had a primary or unique key or
  index. Now they do return rows as expected.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Nuno Faria <nunofpfaria@gmail.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- sql: Added the UNLOGGED TABLE feature.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: The function BBPkeepref now gets a BAT pointer as argument instead of
  a bat id.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: Get rid of macro Tsize, use ->twidth instead.
- gdk: Get rid of macro BUNlast, just use BATcount instead.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- merovingian: Added "loglevel" property for monetdbd logging (to merovingian.log).
  The loglevel can be set to: error or warning or information or debug.
  The loglevel property can be changed dynamically via command:
   monetdbd set loglevel=warning /path/to/dbfarm
  Default the loglevel is set to: information
  When loglevel is error, only errors are logged.
  When loglevel is warning, errors and warnings are logged.
  When loglevel is information, errors and warnings and information messages
  are logged.  When loglevel is debug, all messages are logged.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- merovingian: There is now a loadmodules property that can be used to add --loadmodule
  arguments to the mserver5 command line.  See the monetdb and mserver5
  manual pages.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.1-20220913
- gdk: When adding or subtracting months from a date or timestamp value,
  clamp the result to the calculated month instead of wrapping to the
  beginning of the next month.  See bug 7227.

* Wed Aug 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: A bug was fixed when upgrading a database from the Oct2020 releases
  (11.39.X) or older when the write-ahead log (WAL) was not empty and
  contained instructions to create new tables.

* Tue Aug  2 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: When destroying a bat, make sure there are no files left over in
  the BACKUP directory since they can cause problems when the bat id
  gets reused.

* Thu Jul 28 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: Fixed an off-by-one error in the logger which caused older log files
  to stick around longer in the write-ahead log than necessary.
- gdk: When an empty BAT is committed, skip writing (and synchronizing to
  disk) the heap (tail and theap) files and write 0 for their sizes to
  the BBP.dir file.  When reading the BBP.dir file, if an empty BAT is
  encountered, set the sizes of those files to 0.  This fixes potential
  issues during startup of the server (BBPcheckbats reporting errors).

* Thu Jun 23 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- merovingian: When multiple identical messages are written to the log, write the
  first one, and combine subsequent ones in a single message.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: Make sure heap files of transient bats get deleted when the bat is
  destroyed.  If the bat was a partial view (sharing the vheap but not
  the tail), the tail file wasn't deleted.
- gdk: Various changes were made to satisfy newer compilers.
- gdk: The batDirtydesc and batDirtyflushed Boolean values have been deprecated
  and are no longer used.  They were both holdovers from long ago.
- gdk: Various race conditions (data races) have been fixed.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- merovingian: Fixed a leak where the log file wasn't closed when it was reopened
  after a log rotation (SIGHUP signal).
- merovingian: Try to deal more gracefully with "inherited" mserver5 processes.
  This includes not complaining about an "impossible state", and allowing
  such processes to be stopped by the monetdbd process.
- merovingian: When a transient failure occurs during processing of a new connection to
  the monetdbd server, sleep for half a second so that if the transient
  failure occurs again, the log file doesn't get swamped with error
  messages.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- monetdb5: Various race conditions (data races) have been fixed.

* Fri Jun 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- clients: Implemented dump of global grants, that is to say, grants for COPY INTO
  and COPY FROM which grant permission to users to write to or read from
  files on the server (COPY INTO queries without the ON CLIENT option).

* Tue May 31 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- clients: Fixed a bug where when the semicolon at the end of a COPY INTO query
  that reads from STDIN is at exactly a 10240 byte boundary in a file,
  the data isn't read as input for the COPY INTO but instead as a new
  SQL query.

* Fri May 20 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: All accesses to the BACKUP directory need to be protected by the
  same lock.  The lock already existed (GDKtmLock), but wasn't used
  consistently.  This is now fixed.  Hopefully this makes the hot snapshot
  code more reliable.

* Fri May 20 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7036: Generate column names instead of labels

* Thu May 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- gdk: All accesses to the BACKUP directory need to be protected by the
  same lock.  The lock already existed (GDKtmLock), but wasn't used
  consistently.  This is now fixed.  Hopefully this makes the hot snapshot
  code more reliable.

* Tue May 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- gdk: When exiting, long running instructions are aborted using the same
  mechanism that is used for query timeouts.

* Mon Apr 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- sql: GLOBAL TEMPORARY tables are now treated like LOCAL TEMPORARY tables
  as far as the table content is concerned.  The schema information
  stays global.  This fixes an issue with concurrent access and cleanup
  of stale data.

* Thu Apr 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- sql: The NO CONSTRAINT option of the COPY INTO query has been removed.
  It didn't work and it was never a good idea anyway.

* Fri Apr 01 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.13-20220401
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7278: BUG when there is more than one field/filter in the having
  clause

* Fri Apr  1 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.13-20220401
- gdk: Improved speed of BATappend to empty varsized bat: we now just copy
  the heaps instead of inserting individual values.

* Fri Apr  1 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.13-20220401
- monetdb5: Improved parsing speed of blob values, especially on Windows.
  On Windows, using the locale-aware functions isdigit and isxdigit is
  comparatively very slow, so we avoid them.

* Tue Mar 29 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.13-20220401
- gdk: Improved speed of projection (BATproject) on varsized bats by sharing
  the data heap (vheap).

* Fri Mar 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7252: Segmentation fault on second run
- GH#7253: Extremely slow INSERT INTO <table> SELECT
- GH#7254: Commit with deletions is very slow
- GH#7263: PRIMARY KEY constraint is not persistent through server restarts
- GH#7267: Update after delete does not update some rows

* Fri Mar 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- gdk: Fixed a race condition which could cause a too large size being written
  for a .theap file to the BBP.dir file after the correct size file had
  been saved to disk.
- gdk: We now ignore the size and capacity columns in the BBP.dir file.
  These values are essential during run time, but not useful in the
  on-disk image of the database.

* Wed Mar  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- gdk: Fixed a bug in the append code for msk (bit mask) bats.
- gdk: Conversions from floating point types to integral types that involve
  multiplication now use the "long double" as intermediate type, thereby
  loosing as few significant bits as is feasible.
- gdk: Found and fixed another source for the now infamous BBPcheckbats error
  that sometimes occurs at startup of the server.

* Wed Feb 16 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- clients: Improved the handling of the \r (internal pager) command in mclient.
  It now properly counts the header of table, and when a (very) long
  table is being printed and aborted part way in the built-in pager, not
  all data is transferred to the client (and then discarded).  Instead
  at most 1000 rows are transferred.

* Mon Feb 07 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.9-20220207
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7237: SELECT with concurrent writes rarely returns corrupt data
- GH#7238: query with system function: "index"(varchar, boolean) fails
  with GDK error or assertion failure.
- GH#7241: Replacing a view by a query on the view itself crashes the
  server.

* Thu Feb 03 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.7-20220203
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7228: COMMIT: transaction is aborted because of concurrency
  conflicts, will ROLLBACK instead
- GH#7230: Prepared statement of INSERT with SELECT fails when types difer
- GH#7232: False conflicts when inserting in a not null field

* Mon Jan 24 2022 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.7-20220203
- sql: [This feature was already released in Jan2022 (11.43), but the ChangeLog was missing]
  Added SQL procedures sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string),
  sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string, interval int),
  sys.stop_vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string).
  These can be used to vacuum string columns.

* Tue Jan 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.5-20220118
- Rebuilt.

* Thu Jan 13 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.5-20220118
- NT: We now build Windows binaries using Visual Studio 2022.

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.5-20220118
- gdk: Implement string imprints (strimps for short) a pre-filter structure
  for strings in order to accelerate LIKE queries. If a strimp exists
  for a specific string column the strings are pre-filtered, rejecting
  strings that cannot possibly match, before the more expensive and
  accurate matching algorithms run.

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.5-20220118
- sql: Add string imprints to the existing imprints index creation syntax. On
  string column "col" of a table "tbl" marked read only ("ALTER TABLE tbl
  SET READ ONLY") the user can create a string imprint using the syntax:
  "CREATE IMPRINTS INDEX index_name ON tbl(col);".

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.5-20220118
- MonetDB: A couple of concurrency issues have been fixed.

* Tue Jan 11 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.3-20220111
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7215: ODBC Driver SQLStatistics returns duplicate rows/rows for other
  tables

* Tue Jan 11 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.3-20220111
- gdk: On Windows, files and directories we create now get the attribute
  FILE_ATTIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED, meaning that they should not be
  indexed by indexing or search services.

* Thu Jan  6 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.3-20220111
- merovingian: Disabled logging into merovingian.log of next info message types:
  "proxying client <host>:<port> for database '<dbname>' to <url>" and
  "target connection is on local UNIX domain socket, passing on filedescriptor instead of proxying".
  These messages were written to the log file at each connection. In most
  cases this information is not used. The disabling reduces the log file size.

* Mon Jan 03 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7168: Loosing the documentation
- GH#7180: GROUP BY-subquery crashes MonetDb
- GH#7182: Queries against sys.querylog_catalog, sys.querylog_calls or
  sys.querylog_history fail after restore of a db created using call
  sys.hot_snapshot(R'\path\file.tar');
- GH#7201: Selection of a subquery with a LEFT JOIN returns the wrong
  result set
- GH#7202: DISTINCT does not work when sorting by additional columns

* Wed Dec 15 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- monetdb5: The storage cleanup in the 11.41.5 (Jul2021) release made the OLTP
  optimizer pipeline obsolete, thus it was removed.

* Wed Dec 15 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: With the storage cleanup in the 11.41.5 (Jul2021) release, the ANALYZE
  statement was updated to accomodate those changes. The SAMPLE parameter
  is now ignored because ANALYZE generated statistics used by
  relational operators, are required to be precise.
- sql: In order to mitigate the I/O required to update the 'statistics' table,
  this table is no longer persisted. Alternately, it was changed into a
  computed view every time when queried. The 'stamp' and 'sample' fields
  were removed for the aforementioned reasons. The 'schema', 'table' and
  'column' fields were added for convenience.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: In previous versions there was no check that the INCREMENT BY value of
  a SEQUENCE was not zero.  During the automatic upgrade of a database,
  INCREMENT BY values that are zero are set to one.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The method to compute the 'side_effect' effect property was changed
  for SQL functions defined in the backend engine (eg. ``CREATE FUNCTION
  ... EXTERNAL NAME "module"."function"''). It was changed from being
  computed by the SQL layer to the backend engine itself. As a consequence,
  the computed 'side_effect' value may be different, thus bringing
  incompatibilities. After an upgrade, if a 'side_effect' incompatibility
  arises, either the 'side_effect' value in the backend should be changed or
  the function should be re-created in SQL.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Removed deprecated system view sys.systemfunctions. It was marked
  as deprecated from release Apr2019 (11.33.3).  Use query:
    select id as function_id from sys.functions where system;
  to get the same data as the old view.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Extended SQL system catalog with lookup table sys.fkey_actions and
  view sys.fkeys to provide user friendly querying of existing foreign
  keys and their ON UPDATE and ON DELETE referential action specifications.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Many improvements were done for REMOTE table plans. As a consequence,
  master or slave servers from this feature release are not compatible
  with older releases.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The view sys.ids has been changed to give more information about the
  objects in the system.  In particular, there is an extra column
  added at the end that indicates whether the object is a system
  object.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The example modules opt_sql_append and udf are no longer loaded by
  default and no longer part of the binary release.  If installed,
  they can be loaded using the --loadmodule option.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- clients: A new output formatting mode was added to mclient.  Use -fcsv-noquote
  to produce a CSV (comma-separated values) output where the quote
  characters have not been escapes.  This can be useful when producing
  a single column string output that should be saved as is, e.g. when
  using the sys.dump_database() function.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- gdk: Many (most) low level functions that could take a long time (such as
  BATjoin) can now be aborted with a timeout.  When the function takes too
  long, the function will fail, and hence the whole SQL query will fail.
- gdk: At some point in the past, string heaps were created where the
  hash value of the string was stored in the heap before the string.
  This hasn't been used in a long time.  Now the code that could still
  read those old heaps has been removed.  Bats that used the old format
  are converted automatically.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- misc: Reliance on the OpenSSL library has been removed.  OpenSSL was used
  for the hash algorithms it contained (e.g. SHA512 and RIPEMD160) and
  for producing random numbers.  The hash functions have been replaced
  by the original published functions, and random numbers are generated
  using system-specific random sources (i.e. not simply pseudo-random
  number generators).

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The built-in SQL functions to produce a dump that were added as a
  proof-of-concept in the previous release have been improved and are
  now usable.  Use the query ``SELECT stmt FROM sys.dump_database(FALSE)
  ORDER BY o'' to produce a dump.  The dump code built into mclient and
  msqldump is probably still more efficient, though.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- gdk: Some small interface changes to the atom functions: the atomPut function
  now returns (var_t) -1 on error instead of 0; the atomHeap function
  now returns success or failure as a gdk_return value.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The sys.epoch function has always been confusing.  There are two
  versions, one with an INTEGER argument, and one with a BIGINT
  argument.  The former accepted values as seconds, whereas the
  latter expected milliseconds.  Also, the construct EXTRACT(EPOCH
  FROM value) returns a BIGINT with millisecond precision.  This has
  now been overhauled.  There is no longer a function sys.epoch with
  BIGINT argument, but instead there is a new function sys.epoch with
  DECIMAL(18,3) argument.  The argument is seconds, but with 3 decimals,
  it provides millisecond accuracy. Also the EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM value)
  now returns a DECIMAL(18,3), again seconds with 3 decimals giving
  millisecond accuracy.  Note that the internal, binary representation
  of DECIMAL(18,3) interpreted as seconds with 3 decimals and BIGINT
  with millisecond precision is exactly the same.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- merovingian: Removed the deprecated monetdb commands `profilerstart` and
  `profilerstop`.
