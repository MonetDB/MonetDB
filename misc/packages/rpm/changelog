- odbc: When connecting using a DSN (Data Source Name), information about the
  data source is retrieved from the ODBC.INI file.  Now we also get the
  location of the LOGFILE from this file.  The logfile can be used to
  log all calls to the MonetDB ODBC driver to a file which can be used
  for debugging.

* Thu Mar 25 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- odbc: The ODBC driver now only passes on information about HUGEINT columns
  as HUGEINT when the application has indicated interest by querying
  about the SQL_HUGEINT extension type using the SQLGetTypeInfo
  function or by specifying the type in a call to SQLSetDescField.
  Otherwise the driver silently translates the HUGEINT type to BIGINT.
  This means that most application will see BIGINT columns when the
  server produced a HUGEINT column and only give an error if the value
  in the HUGEINT column didn't fit into a BIGINT.

* Thu Aug 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.1-20201006
- monetdb5: The settings for specifying how mserver5 should listen to "The
  Internet" have been overhauled.  See the manual for details.  In
  brief, mapi_autosense, mapi_ipv6 and mapi_open are gone.  If
  mapi_listenaddr equals "localhost" or "all", we listen to both IPv4
  and IPv6 (if available), if "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0", we listen to
  IPv4 only, if "::1" or "::" we listen to IPv6 only.  The first of
  each pair is loopback interface only, the second is all interfaces.
  If mapi_listenaddr is "none", then no IP port is opened, you need to
  use a UNIX domain socket.  If mapi_port is 0, we let the operating
  system choose a free port (like mapi_autosense).  Default behavior
  has not changed.

* Mon Aug 10 2020 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- MonetDB: Finished a first version of the new monitoring function
  user_statistics(), which is only intended for the DBAs.
  For each database user who has logged in during the current mserver5
  session, it returns
  "username": login name of the database user,
  "querycount": the number of queries this user has executed since his/her
      first login,
  "totalticks": the total execution time (in microsecond) of the queries ran
      by this user,
  "maxquery": the query with the longest execution time (if two queries have
      the same execution time, the newer overwrites the older),
  "maxticks": the execution time of the 'maxquery' (in microsecond),
  "started": the start timestamp of the 'maxquery',
  "finished": the finish timestamp of the 'maxquery'.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Removed compatibility between interval types and other numeric types in
  favor for a more strict SQL standard compliance. This means operations
  between temporal types and other numeric types such as INT and
  DECIMAL are no longer possible, instead use interval types.
  e.g. SELECT date '2020-01-01' + 1; now gives the error. Instead do:
  SELECT date '2020-01-01' + interval '1' day; if 1 was meant to be a
  day interval.
  Setting an interval variable such as the session's current timezone
  with a number e.g. SET current_timezone = 1; is no longer possible.
  Instead do SET current_timezone = interval '1' hour;
  Casting between interval and other numeric types is no longer possible
  as well, because they are not compatible.
- sql: Because of incompatibilities this change may create, if a user intends
  to convert a numeric value to an interval, the multiplication function
  can be used in the form: <numeric value> * interval '1' <interval length>
  e.g. 10 * interval '1' second = interval '10' second.
  As for the other way around, the 'EPOCH' option was added to the extract
  syntax. This option returns the number of milliseconds since the UNIX
  epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for date, timestamp and time values (it
  can be negative). Meanwhile, for day and second intervals, it returns the
  total number of milliseconds in the interval. As a side note, the 'EPOCH'
  option is not available for month intervals, because this conversion is
  not transparent for this type.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.1-20201006
- MonetDB: Removed support for LiDAR data, that is the SQL procedures
  sys.lidarattach, sys.lidarload, and sys.lidarexport.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Removed '@' syntax used to refer into a variable in a query. It
  was a non-standard method, which was replaced by a schema addition to
  variables. Variables in the global scope now have schema. All default
  global variables are set under schema "sys". However variables
  inside PSM don't have a schema, because there are no transaction
  semantics inside PSM at the moment.
- sql: Removed declared variables and tables from the global scope. They were
  transaction agnostic and incompatible with the SQL standard, i.e. they
  are valid exclusively under PSM (e.g. functions, procedures and
  triggers).
- sql: Scoping semantics were added for both variables and tables. Variables
  with the same name at a query are now resolved under the following
  precedence rules:
    1. Tables, Views and CTEs at the FROM clause.
    2. Variable declared in the body of function/procedure, i.e. local
       variable.
    3. Function/procedure parameter.
    4. Variable from the global scope.
  Tables with the same name now have the following precedence rules at a
  SQL query:
    1. Table declared in the body of function/procedure, ie local table.
    2. Temporary table.
    3. Table from the current session schema.
  This means the query: SELECT * FROM "keys"; will list keys from
  temporary tables instead of persisted ones, because "keys" table
  is available for both "sys" and "tmp" schemas.
- sql: The table returning function "var" was extended with more details
  about globally declared variables, namely their schema, type and
  current value.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- MonetDB: The sys.queue() has been turned into a circular buffer to allow for
  inspection of both active, paused and recently executed queries.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Extended the system monitor with a table-returning function
  user_statistics() which keeps some statistics for each SQL user, e.g. the
  user's query count, total time spent, and maximal query seen.

- selinux: There was a problem with the MonetDB SELinux support on Fedora 32.
  That is fixed in this release.  In order to do a proper upgrade of
  the package if you have already installed MonetDB-selinux on Fedora
  32, you may need to uninstall (dnf remove) the old package and then
  install the new.

* Tue Apr 28 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: The functions BATintersect, BATsemijoin, and BATsubcross have an

- clients: The monetdb-client-tools (Debian/Ubuntu) and MonetDB-client-tools
  (Fedora/RH) containing the stethoscope, tachograph, and tomograph has
  been removed.  A completely new version of stethoscope will be released
  to replace the old version.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: The "unique" property on BATs was removed.  The property indicated
  that all values in a BAT *had* to be distinct, but this was not
  actually used.
- gdk: A new type of candidate list has been introduced.  Candidate lists
  are used internally to specify which rows of a column participate
  in an operation.  Before, candidate lists always contained a list of
  candidate row IDs.  The new candidate list type specifies a list of
  row IDs that should NOT be considered (negative candidates).
- gdk: The maximum number of BATs in the system has been increased for 64
  bit architectures.
- gdk: The hash tables used internally by the system now uses a technique
  based on Linear Hashing which allows them to grow gracefully.  This
  means that hash tables aren't removed and recreated nearly as often
  anymore.  This also meant that the hash table had to be split into
  two files, which means that after an upgrade the hash tables have to
  be recreated.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- merovingian: On Fedora and RHEL systems (not RHEL 6), if monetdbd runs under systemd,
  when the package is updated, monetdbd (and hence any mserver5 process
  it runs) is restarted.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: The example module opt_sql_append is not installed in the binary
  packages anymore.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- MonetDB: A new system to deal with debug output has been implemented.  There is
  now an option --dbtrace to mserver5 that takes a file argument to which
  debug output is written.  The default value is the file mdbtrace.log
  inside the database directory.  This option can also be set through
  the monetdb program.
- MonetDB: The home directory of the automatically created monetdb user was
  changed from /var/MonetDB to /var/lib/monetdb (RPM based systems
  only).  This home directory is (currently) not used for anything,
  though.
- MonetDB: Python 2 support has been removed.  There is now only support for
  using Python 3.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- odbc: The NUMERIC and FLOAT types are now handled fully.  Before only DECIMAL,
  FLOAT, and DOUBLE were handled fully.
- odbc: Some bugs were fixed in the passing back and forth between application
  and server of values of type GUID (UUID).

* Thu Apr 16 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- clients: Removed the possibility of using the MD5 checksum for authentication
  purposes.  It was never actively used but was there as an option.
  Now the option has been removed.

  querylog and uses a threshold in milliseconds.

* Wed Apr 15 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Removed UNION JOIN statements. They were dropped by the SQL:2003

  newlines.  Before it counted "unquoted record separators" which meant
  that if you had a single quote on a line that you want to skip, you
  could not use the feature.

* Mon Mar 30 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: Implemented a version of BATproject, called BATproject2, with two
  "right" arguments which conceptually follow each other.

* Fri Mar 27 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Added support for FROM RANGE MINVALUE TO RANGE MAXVALUE and FROM RANGE
  MINVALUE TO RANGE MAXVALUE WITH NULL VALUES cases in partitioned tables
  by range (before they weren't).

* Wed Mar 25 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: Removed MT_mmap and MT_munmap from the list of exported functions.
  Use GDKmmap and GDKmunmap with the same parameters instead.

* Fri Mar 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: Changed the interface of the atom "fix" and "unfix" functions.
  They now return a value of type gdk_return to indicate success/failure.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Thodoris Zois <thodoris.zois@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- merovingian: Added dbtrace mserver5 option to the daemon in order to set
  mserver5's output directory for the produced traces.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Thodoris Zois <thodoris.zois@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: Added mserver5 option (--dbtrace=<path>) in order to be able to
  specify the output file any produced traces.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- clients: Add port and host as fields in the .monetdb file.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- MonetDB: Removed support for bam and sam files.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Implemented 'covar_pop' and 'covar_samp' aggregate functions, as well
  as their window function counterparts. Implemented 'stddev_samp',
  'stddev_pop', 'var_samp', 'var_pop', 'corr' and 'group_concat'
  window function correspondents.
- sql: Extended SQL catalog with CREATE WINDOW syntax for user-defined
  SQL:2003 window functions. At the moment, window functions must be
  defined on the backend engine, i.e. on this case MAL. In the current
  implementation, the backend code generation creates two additional
  columns of type lng with the start and end offsets for each row.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Removed support for Python 2.  Python 2 itself is no longer
  supported.  Use Python 3 instead.  Functions that were declared as
  LANGUAGE PYTHON2 or LANGUAGE PYTHON2_MAP are changed to LANGUAGE
  PYTHON and LANGUAGE PYTHON_MAP respectively (without changing the
  Python code).

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Added prepared_statements_args view, which details the arguments for
  the prepared statements created in the current session.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Added sys.prepared_statements view, which lists the available prepared
  statements in the current session.
- sql: Added deallocate statements with the syntax 'DEALLOCATE [PREPARE]
  { number | ALL }', to close an existing prepared statement or all,
  through the SQL layer. Previously this feature was available via MAPI
  exclusively with the "release" command.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- MonetDB: Added mserver5 option (--set raw_strings=true|false) and monetdb
  database property (raw_strings=yes|no) to control interpretation
  of strings.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: Removed the tunique property.  The tunique property indicated that
  all values in the column had to be distinct.  It was removed because
  it wasn't used.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: Removed function bat.setKey().

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Added support for raw strings using the syntax r'' or R''. This means
  that C-like escapes will remain uninterpreted within those strings. For
  instance SELECT r'\"' returns a string of length two. The user needs
  to escape single quotes by doubling them: SELECT r''''.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Implemented ROLLUP, CUBE and GROUPING SETS from SQL:1999. They
  define grouping subsets used with the GROUP BY clause in order to
  compute partial groupings. Also, the GROUPING aggregate was
  added. This aggregate is a bitmask identifying the grouping columns
  not present in the generated grouping row when used with the
  operators described above.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- gdk: BATrangeselect now has two extra arguments: anti and symmetric
  (both bool).

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: algebra.rangejoin now has two extra arguments: anti:bit and
  symmetric:bit.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: Added session identifier, number of workers and memory claim to the
  sysmon queue.
- monetdb5: The worker (number of threads), memory (in MB) and optimizer pipeline
  limits can now be set per user session basis. The query and session
  timeouts are now set in seconds.
- monetdb5: With required privileges an user can set resource limits for a session.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Updated user session procedures by adding the possibility to set properties
  based on a session identifier.
  Optimizer pipeline: sys.setoptimizer(int, string)
  Number of worker threads: sys.setworkerlimit(int, int)
  Memory limits (in MB): sys.setmemorylimit(int, int)
  Query timeout (in ms): sys.setquerytimeout(int, int)
  Session timeout (in ms): sys.setsessiontimeout(int, int)
  The first argument corresponds to the id of the session to modify, and
  these procedures are bound to the monetdb user exclusively.
  The versions of the mentioned procedures with just the second argument were
  added as well, where the changes are reflected in the current user session,
  and therefore every user can call them.
- sql: The procedures sys.settimeout(bigint), sys.settimeout(bigint,bigint)
  and sys.session(bigint) are now deprecated. Instead use sys.setquerytimeout
  and sys.setsessiontimeout mentioned above.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: There are now versions of group.(sub)group(done) that produce a single
  output containing just the groups.
- monetdb5: algebra.join and algebra.leftjoin now have forms which return a single
  column.  The column that is returned is the left column of the two
  column version.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- sql: Added SQL procedure sys.hot_snapshot() which can be used to write
  a snapshot of the database to a tar file. For example,
  sys.hot_snapshot('/tmp/snapshot.tar'). If compression support is
  compiled in, snapshots can also be compressed ('/tmp/snapshot.tar.gz').
  The tar file expands to a single directory with the same name as the
  database that was snapshotted. This directory can be passed directly
  as the --dbpath argument of mserver5 or it can be copied into an
  existing dbfarm and started from monetdbd.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- clients: Added 'sessionid' column to system function sys.queue(), so each query
  gets tagged with the current session identifier

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.37.1-20200511
- clients: Allow monetdb user to control session and query time out and selectively
  stopping a client sessions with a soft termination request.

* Sat Feb 22 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.37.1-20200511
- monetdb5: The MAL profiler now assigns the SQL TRACE output to the client record
  thereby avoiding the interaction with other queries, but loosing
  insight of competing queries. The stethoscope should be used for that.
