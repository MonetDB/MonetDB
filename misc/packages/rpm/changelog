- gdk: Memory leaks have been fixed.

* Wed Nov  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.25-20221121
- monetdb5: A race condition in the SHA hash code was fixed which resulted in
  occasional failed connection attempts when they occurred concurrently.

* Wed Oct 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.25-20221121
- monetdb5: Fix a bug where the MAL optimizer would use the starttime of the
  previous query to determine whether a query timeout occurred.

* Wed Oct 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.25-20221121

* Mon Oct 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.25-20221121
- gdk: Offset heaps (.tailN files) were growing too fast and unnecessarily
  under certain conditions.  This has been fixed.  Also, when such too
  large files are now loaded into the system, it is recognized they are
  too large and they are truncated to a more reasonable size.

- gdk: Fixed a bug in ORDER BY with both NULLS LAST and LIMIT when the ordering
  was on an interger or integer-like column and NULL values are present.

* Mon Sep 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.23-20221003

  thoroughly enough.

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.23-20221003
- gdk: The median_avg and quantile_avg returned bogus results in the
  non-grouped case (i.e. something like SELECT sys.median_avg(i) FROM t).

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.23-20221003
- merovingian: In certain cases (when an mserver5 process exits right after producing
  a message) the log message was logged over and over again, causing
  monetdbd to use 100% CPU.  This has been fixed.

- gdk: A bug was fixed when upgrading a database from the Oct2020 releases
  (11.39.X) or older when the write-ahead log (WAL) was not empty and
  contained instructions to create new tables.

* Tue Aug  2 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: When destroying a bat, make sure there are no files left over in
  the BACKUP directory since they can cause problems when the bat id
  gets reused.

* Thu Jul 28 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: Fixed an off-by-one error in the logger which caused older log files
  to stick around longer in the write-ahead log than necessary.
- gdk: When an empty BAT is committed, skip writing (and synchronizing to
  disk) the heap (tail and theap) files and write 0 for their sizes to
  the BBP.dir file.  When reading the BBP.dir file, if an empty BAT is
  encountered, set the sizes of those files to 0.  This fixes potential
  issues during startup of the server (BBPcheckbats reporting errors).

* Thu Jun 23 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- merovingian: When multiple identical messages are written to the log, write the
  first one, and combine subsequent ones in a single message.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: Make sure heap files of transient bats get deleted when the bat is
  destroyed.  If the bat was a partial view (sharing the vheap but not
  the tail), the tail file wasn't deleted.
- gdk: Various changes were made to satisfy newer compilers.
- gdk: The batDirtydesc and batDirtyflushed Boolean values have been deprecated
  and are no longer used.  They were both holdovers from long ago.
- gdk: Various race conditions (data races) have been fixed.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- merovingian: Fixed a leak where the log file wasn't closed when it was reopened
  after a log rotation (SIGHUP signal).
- merovingian: Try to deal more gracefully with "inherited" mserver5 processes.
  This includes not complaining about an "impossible state", and allowing
  such processes to be stopped by the monetdbd process.
- merovingian: When a transient failure occurs during processing of a new connection to
  the monetdbd server, sleep for half a second so that if the transient
  failure occurs again, the log file doesn't get swamped with error
  messages.

- clients: Implemented dump of global grants, that is to say, grants for COPY INTO
  and COPY FROM which grant permission to users to write to or read from
  files on the server (COPY INTO queries without the ON CLIENT option).

* Tue May 31 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- clients: Fixed a bug where when the semicolon at the end of a COPY INTO query
  that reads from STDIN is at exactly a 10240 byte boundary in a file,
  the data isn't read as input for the COPY INTO but instead as a new
  SQL query.

* Fri May 20 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.17-20220811
- gdk: All accesses to the BACKUP directory need to be protected by the

* Mon Apr 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520
- sql: GLOBAL TEMPORARY tables are now treated like LOCAL TEMPORARY tables
  as far as the table content is concerned.  The schema information
  stays global.  This fixes an issue with concurrent access and cleanup
  of stale data.

* Thu Apr 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.15-20220520

* Fri Apr  1 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.13-20220401
- monetdb5: Improved parsing speed of blob values, especially on Windows.
  On Windows, using the locale-aware functions isdigit and isxdigit is

* Fri Mar 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- gdk: Fixed a race condition which could cause a too large size being written
  for a .theap file to the BBP.dir file after the correct size file had
  been saved to disk.
- gdk: We now ignore the size and capacity columns in the BBP.dir file.
  These values are essential during run time, but not useful in the
  on-disk image of the database.

* Wed Mar  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- gdk: Fixed a bug in the append code for msk (bit mask) bats.
- gdk: Conversions from floating point types to integral types that involve
  multiplication now use the "long double" as intermediate type, thereby
  loosing as few significant bits as is feasible.
- gdk: Found and fixed another source for the now infamous BBPcheckbats error
  that sometimes occurs at startup of the server.

* Wed Feb 16 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.11-20220325
- clients: Improved the handling of the \r (internal pager) command in mclient.
  It now properly counts the header of table, and when a (very) long
  table is being printed and aborted part way in the built-in pager, not
  all data is transferred to the client (and then discarded).  Instead
  at most 1000 rows are transferred.

- sql: [This feature was already released in Jan2022 (11.43), but the ChangeLog was missing]
  Added SQL procedures sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string),
  sys.vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string, interval int),
  sys.stop_vacuum(sname string, tname string, cname string).
  These can be used to vacuum string columns.

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.5-20220118
- gdk: Implement string imprints (strimps for short) a pre-filter structure
  for strings in order to accelerate LIKE queries. If a strimp exists
  for a specific string column the strings are pre-filtered, rejecting
  strings that cannot possibly match, before the more expensive and
  accurate matching algorithms run.

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.5-20220118
- sql: Add string imprints to the existing imprints index creation syntax. On
  string column "col" of a table "tbl" marked read only ("ALTER TABLE tbl
  SET READ ONLY") the user can create a string imprint using the syntax:
  "CREATE IMPRINTS INDEX index_name ON tbl(col);".

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.5-20220118

* Tue Jan 11 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.3-20220111
- gdk: On Windows, files and directories we create now get the attribute
  FILE_ATTIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED, meaning that they should not be
  indexed by indexing or search services.

* Thu Jan  6 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.3-20220111
- merovingian: Disabled logging into merovingian.log of next info message types:
  "proxying client <host>:<port> for database '<dbname>' to <url>" and
  "target connection is on local UNIX domain socket, passing on filedescriptor instead of proxying".
  These messages were written to the log file at each connection. In most
  cases this information is not used. The disabling reduces the log file size.

* Mon Jan 03 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103

* Wed Dec 15 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- monetdb5: The storage cleanup in the 11.41.5 (Jul2021) release made the OLTP
  optimizer pipeline obsolete, thus it was removed.

* Wed Dec 15 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: With the storage cleanup in the 11.41.5 (Jul2021) release, the ANALYZE
  statement was updated to accomodate those changes. The SAMPLE parameter
  is now ignored because ANALYZE generated statistics used by
  relational operators, are required to be precise.
- sql: In order to mitigate the I/O required to update the 'statistics' table,
  this table is no longer persisted. Alternately, it was changed into a
  computed view every time when queried. The 'stamp' and 'sample' fields
  were removed for the aforementioned reasons. The 'schema', 'table' and
  'column' fields were added for convenience.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: In previous versions there was no check that the INCREMENT BY value of
  a SEQUENCE was not zero.  During the automatic upgrade of a database,
  INCREMENT BY values that are zero are set to one.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The method to compute the 'side_effect' effect property was changed
  for SQL functions defined in the backend engine (eg. ``CREATE FUNCTION
  ... EXTERNAL NAME "module"."function"''). It was changed from being
  computed by the SQL layer to the backend engine itself. As a consequence,
  the computed 'side_effect' value may be different, thus bringing
  incompatibilities. After an upgrade, if a 'side_effect' incompatibility
  arises, either the 'side_effect' value in the backend should be changed or
  the function should be re-created in SQL.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Removed deprecated system view sys.systemfunctions. It was marked
  as deprecated from release Apr2019 (11.33.3).  Use query:
    select id as function_id from sys.functions where system;
  to get the same data as the old view.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Extended SQL system catalog with lookup table sys.fkey_actions and
  view sys.fkeys to provide user friendly querying of existing foreign
  keys and their ON UPDATE and ON DELETE referential action specifications.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: Many improvements were done for REMOTE table plans. As a consequence,
  master or slave servers from this feature release are not compatible
  with older releases.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The view sys.ids has been changed to give more information about the
  objects in the system.  In particular, there is an extra column
  added at the end that indicates whether the object is a system
  object.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The example modules opt_sql_append and udf are no longer loaded by
  default and no longer part of the binary release.  If installed,
  they can be loaded using the --loadmodule option.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- clients: A new output formatting mode was added to mclient.  Use -fcsv-noquote
  to produce a CSV (comma-separated values) output where the quote
  characters have not been escapes.  This can be useful when producing
  a single column string output that should be saved as is, e.g. when
  using the sys.dump_database() function.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- gdk: Many (most) low level functions that could take a long time (such as
  BATjoin) can now be aborted with a timeout.  When the function takes too
  long, the function will fail, and hence the whole SQL query will fail.
- gdk: At some point in the past, string heaps were created where the
  hash value of the string was stored in the heap before the string.
  This hasn't been used in a long time.  Now the code that could still
  read those old heaps has been removed.  Bats that used the old format
  are converted automatically.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- misc: Reliance on the OpenSSL library has been removed.  OpenSSL was used
  for the hash algorithms it contained (e.g. SHA512 and RIPEMD160) and
  for producing random numbers.  The hash functions have been replaced
  by the original published functions, and random numbers are generated
  using system-specific random sources (i.e. not simply pseudo-random
  number generators).

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The built-in SQL functions to produce a dump that were added as a
  proof-of-concept in the previous release have been improved and are
  now usable.  Use the query ``SELECT stmt FROM sys.dump_database(FALSE)
  ORDER BY o'' to produce a dump.  The dump code built into mclient and
  msqldump is probably still more efficient, though.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- gdk: Some small interface changes to the atom functions: the atomPut function
  now returns (var_t) -1 on error instead of 0; the atomHeap function
  now returns success or failure as a gdk_return value.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.1-20220103
- sql: The sys.epoch function has always been confusing.  There are two
  versions, one with an INTEGER argument, and one with a BIGINT
  argument.  The former accepted values as seconds, whereas the
  latter expected milliseconds.  Also, the construct EXTRACT(EPOCH
  FROM value) returns a BIGINT with millisecond precision.  This has
  now been overhauled.  There is no longer a function sys.epoch with
  BIGINT argument, but instead there is a new function sys.epoch with
  DECIMAL(18,3) argument.  The argument is seconds, but with 3 decimals,
  it provides millisecond accuracy. Also the EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM value)
  now returns a DECIMAL(18,3), again seconds with 3 decimals giving
  millisecond accuracy.  Note that the internal, binary representation
  of DECIMAL(18,3) interpreted as seconds with 3 decimals and BIGINT
  with millisecond precision is exactly the same.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.43.1-20220103
- merovingian: Removed the deprecated monetdb commands `profilerstart` and
  `profilerstop`.

  states of tables.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- gdk: Sometimes when the server was restarted, it wouldn't start anymore due
  to an error from BBPcheckbats.  We finally found and fixed a (hopefully
  "the") cause of this problem.

* Thu Oct 28 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- sql: Number parsing for SQL was fixed.  If a number was immediately followed
  by letters (i.e. without a space), the number was accepted and the
  alphanumeric string starting with the letter was interpreted as an alias
  (if aliases were allowed in that position).

- gdk: Handling of the list of free bats has been improved, leading to less
  thread contention.
- gdk: A problem was fixed where the server wouldn't start with a message from
  BBPcheckbats about files being too small.  The issue was not that the
  file was too small, but that BBPcheckbats was looking at the wrong file.
- gdk: An issue was fixed where a "short read" error was produced when memory
  was getting tight.

* Wed Sep 22 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: If the server has been idle for a while with no active clients, the
  write-ahead log is now rotated.
- sql: A problem was fixed where files belonging to bats that had been deleted
  internally were not cleaned up, leading to a growing database (dbfarm)
  directory.
- sql: A leak was fixed where extra bats were created but never cleaned up,
  each taking up several kilobytes of memory.

* Tue Aug 17 2021 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: [This feature was already released in Jul2021 (11.41.5), but the ChangeLog was missing]
  Grant indirect privileges.  With "GRANT SELECT ON <my_view> TO
  <another_user>"  and "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION <my_func> TO
  <another_user>", one can grant access to "my_view" and "my_func"
  to another user who does not have access to the underlying database
  objects (e.g. tables, views) used in "my_view" and "my_func".  The
  grantee will only be able to access data revealed by "my_view" or
  conduct operations provided by "my_func".

* Mon Aug 16 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: Improved error reporting in COPY INTO by giving the line number
  (starting with one) for the row in which an error was found.  In
  particular, the sys.rejects() table now lists the line number of the
  CSV file on which the record started in which an error was found.

* Wed Aug 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- gdk: When appending to a string bat, we made an optimization where the string
  heap was sometimes copied completely to avoid having to insert strings
  individually.  This copying was still done too eagerly, so now the
  string heap is copied less frequently.  In particular, when appending
  to an empty bat, the string heap is now not always copied whole.

* Tue Aug 03 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.5-20210803
- Rebuilt.

* Tue Aug  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.5-20210803
- sql: The system view sys.ids has been updated to include some more system
  IDs.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- Rebuilt.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- gdk: Hash indexes are no longer maintained at all cost: if the number of
  distinct values is too small compared to the total number of values,
  the index is dropped instead of being maintained during updates.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- sql: The sys.storage() function now only returns meta data, i.e. data that
  can be calculated without access to the column contents.

* Wed Jul 28 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- sql: Since STREAM tables support is removed, left over STREAM tables are
  dropped from the catalog.

* Fri Jul 23 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- mapilib: Add optional MAPI header field which can be used to immediately
  set reply size, autocommit, time zone and some other options, see
  mapi.h.  This makes client connection setup faster.  Support has been
  added to mapilib, pymonetdb and the jdbc driver.

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Fix a warning emitted by some implementations of the tar(1) command
  when unpacking hot snapshot files.
- sql: support reading the concatenation of compressed files as a single
  compressed file.
- sql: COPY BINARY overhaul.  Allow control over binary endianness using
  COPY [ (BIG | LITTLE | NATIVE) ENDIAN] BINARY syntax.  Defaults to
  NATIVE.  Strings are now \0 terminated rather than \n.  Support for
  BOOL, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, LARGEINT, HUGEINT, with their
  respective "INTMIN" values as the NULL representation; 32 and 64 bit
  FLOAT/REAL, with NaN as the NULL representation; VARCHAR/TEXT, JSON
  and URL with \x80 as the NULL representation; UUID as fixed width 16
  byte binary values, with (by default) all zeroes as the NULL
  representation; temporal type structs as defined in copybinary.h
  with any invalid value as the NULL representation.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: In the Jul2021 release the storage and transaction layers have
  undergone major changes.  The goal of these changes is robust
  performance under inserts/updates and deletes and lowering the
  transaction startup costs, allowing faster (small) queries.  Where
  the old transaction layer duplicated a lot of data structures during
  startup, the new layer shares the same tree.  Using object
  timestamps the isolation of object is guaranteed.  On the storage
  side the timestamps indicate whether a row is visible (deleted or
  valid), to a transaction as well.  The changes also give some slight
  changes on the perceived transactional behavior.  The new
  implementation uses shared structures among all transactions, which
  do not allow multiple changes of the same object.  And we then
  follow the principle of the first writer wins, i.e., if a
  transaction creates a table with name 'table_name', and concurrently
  one other transaction does the same the later of the two will fail
  with a concurrency conflict error message (even if the first writer
  never commits).  We expect most users not to notice this change, as
  such schema changes aren't usually done concurrently.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- clients: The MonetDB stethoscope has been removed.  There is now a separate
  package available with PIP (monetdb_stethoscope) or as an RPM or DEB
  package (stethoscope) from the monetdb.org repository.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: A new type, called msk, was introduced.  This is a bit mask type.
  In a bat with type msk, each row occupies a single bit, so 8 rows are
  stored in a single byte.  There is no NULL value for this type.
- gdk: The function of the BAT iterator (type BATiter, function bat_iterator)
  has been expanded.  The iterator now contains more information about
  the BAT, and it contains a pointer to the heaps (theap and tvheap)
  that are stable, at least in the sense that they will remain available
  even when parallel threads update the BAT and cause those heaps to grow
  (and therefore possibly move in memory).  A call to bat_iterator must
  now be accompanied by a call to bat_iterator_end.

* Mon Jun  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: When using the --in-memory option, mserver5 will run completely in
  memory, i.e. not create a database on disk.  The server can still be
  connected to using the name of the in-memory database.  This name is
  "in-memory".

* Tue May 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: There is now a function sys.current_sessionid() to return the session
  ID of the current session.  This ID corresponds with the sessionid in
  the sys.queue() result.

* Mon May 10 2021 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: Deprecate `profilerstart` and `profilerstop` commands. Since
  stethoscope is a separate project (https://github.com/MonetDBSolutions/monetdb-pystethoscope)
  the installation directory is not standard anymore. `profilerstart` and
  `profilerstop` commands assume that the stethoscope executable is in the
  same directory as `mserver5`. This is no longer necessarily true since
  stethoscope can now be installed in a python virtual environment. The
  commands still work if stethoscope is installed using the official
  MonetDB installers, or if a symbolic link is created in the directory
  where `mserver5` is located.

* Fri May  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- odbc: A typo that made the SQLSpecialColumns function unusable was fixed.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Merge statements could not produce correct results on complex join
  conditions, so a renovation was made. As a consequence, subqueries
  now have to be disabled on merge join conditions.

* Mon May  3 2021 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: preserve in-query comments

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: The exittimeout value can now be set to a negative value (e.g. -1) to
  indicate that when stopping the dbfarm (using monetdbd stop dbfarm),
  any mserver5 processes are to be sent a termination signal and then
  waited for until they terminate.  In addition, if exittimeout is greater
  than zero, the mserver5 processes are sent a SIGKILL signal after the
  specified timeout and the managing monetdbd is sent a SIGKILL signal
  after another five seconds (if it didn't terminate already).  The old
  situation was that the managing monetdbd process was sent a SIGKILL
  after 30 seconds, and the mserver5 processes that hadn't terminated
  yet would be allowed to continue their termination sequence.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented function BUNreplacemultiincr to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, starting at a given position.
- gdk: Implemented new function BUNreplacemulti to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, at the given positions.
- gdk: Removed function BUNinplace, just use BUNreplace, and check whether
  the BAT argument is of type TYPE_void before calling if you don't
  want to materialize.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Use of CTEs inside UPDATE and DELETE statements are now more
  restrict. Previously they could be used without any extra specification
  in the query (eg. with "v1"("c1") as (...) delete from "t"
  where "t"."c1" = "v1"."c1"), however this was not conformant with the
  SQL standard. In order to use them, they must be specified in the FROM
  clause in UPDATE statements or inside a subquery.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented a function BUNappendmulti which appends an array of values
  to a BAT.  It is a generalization of the function BUNappend.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Changed the interface of the atom read function.  It now requires an
  extra pointer to a size_t value that gives the current size of the
  destination buffer, and when that buffer is too small, it receives the
  size of the reallocated buffer that is large enough.  In any case,
  and as before, the return value is a pointer to the destination buffer.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Environment variables (sys.env()) must be UTF-8, but since they can
  contain file names which may not be UTF-8, there is now a mechanism
  to store the original values outside of sys.env() and store
  %-escaped (similar to URL escaping) values in the environment.  The
  key must still be UTF-8.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: We now save the location of the min and max values when known.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Added 'schema path' property to user, specifying a list of schemas
  to be searched on to find SQL objects such as tables and
  functions. The scoping rules have been updated to support this feature
  and it now finds SQL objects in the following order:
   1. On occasions with multiple tables (e.g. add foreign key constraint,
      add table to a merge table), the child will be searched on the
      parent's schema.
   2. For tables only, declared tables on the stack.
   3. 'tmp' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
   4. Session's current schema.
   5. Each schema from the 'schema path' in order.
   6. 'sys' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
  Whenever the full path is specified, ie "schema"."object", no search will
  be made besides on the explicit schema.
- sql: To update the schema path ALTER USER x SCHEMA PATH y; statement was added.
  [SCHEMA PATH string] syntax was added to the CREATE USER statement.
  The schema path must be a single string where each schema must be between
  double quotes and separated with a single comma, e.g. '"sch1","sch2"'
  For every created user, if the schema path is not given, '"sys"' will be
  the default schema path.
- sql: Changes in the schema path won't be reflected on currently connected users,
  therefore they have to re-connect to see the change. Non existent schemas
  on the path will be ignored.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Leftover STREAM table definition from Datacell extension was removed
  from the parser. They had no effect anymore.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: By using the option "--dbextra=in-memory", mserver5 can be instructed
  to keep transient BATs completely in memory.
