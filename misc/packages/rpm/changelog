* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- mapilib: Add optional MAPI header field which can be used to immediately
  set reply size, autocommit, time zone and some other options, see
  mapi.h.  This makes client connection setup faster.  Support has been
  added to mapilib, pymonetdb and the jdbc driver.

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Fix a warning emitted by some implementations of the tar(1) command
  when unpacking hot snapshot files.
- sql: support reading the concatenation of compressed files as a single
  compressed file.
- sql: COPY BINARY overhaul.  Allow control over binary endianness using
  COPY [ (BIG | LITTLE | NATIVE) ENDIAN] BINARY syntax.  Defaults to
  NATIVE.  Strings are now \0 terminated rather than \n.  Support for
  BOOL, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, LARGEINT, HUGEINT, with their
  respective "INTMIN" values as the NULL representation; 32 and 64 bit
  FLOAT/REAL, with NaN as the NULL representation; VARCHAR/TEXT, JSON
  and URL with \x80 as the NULL representation; UUID as fixed width 16
  byte binary values, with (by default) all zeroes as the NULL
  representation; temporal type structs as defined in copybinary.h
  with any invalid value as the NULL representation.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: In the Jul2021 release the storage and transaction layers have
  undergone major changes.  The goal of these changes is robust
  performance under inserts/updates and deletes and lowering the
  transaction startup costs, allowing faster (small) queries.  Where
  the old transaction layer duplicated a lot of data structures during
  startup, the new layer shares the same tree.  Using object
  timestamps the isolation of object is guaranteed.  On the storage
  side the timestamps indicate whether a row is visible (deleted or
  valid), to a transaction as well.  The changes also give some slight
  changes on the perceived transactional behavior.  The new
  implementation uses shared structures among all transactions, which
  do not allow multiple changes of the same object.  And we then
  follow the principle of the first writer wins, i.e., if a
  transaction creates a table with name 'table_name', and concurrently
  one other transaction does the same the later of the two will fail
  with a concurrency conflict error message (even if the first writer
  never commits).  We expect most users not to notice this change, as
  such schema changes aren't usually done concurrently.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- clients: The MonetDB stethoscope has been removed.  There is now a separate
  package available with PIP (monetdb_stethoscope) or as an RPM or DEB
  package (stethoscope) from the monetdb.org repository.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: A new type, called msk, was introduced.  This is a bit mask type.
  In a bat with type msk, each row occupies a single bit, so 8 rows are
  stored in a single byte.  There is no NULL value for this type.
- gdk: The function of the BAT iterator (type BATiter, function bat_iterator)
  has been expanded.  The iterator now contains more information about
  the BAT, and it contains a pointer to the heaps (theap and tvheap)
  that are stable, at least in the sense that they will remain available
  even when parallel threads update the BAT and cause those heaps to grow
  (and therefore possibly move in memory).  A call to bat_iterator must
  now be accompanied by a call to bat_iterator_end.

* Mon Jun  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: When using the --in-memory option, mserver5 will run completely in
  memory, i.e. not create a database on disk.  The server can still be
  connected to using the name of the in-memory database.  This name is
  "in-memory".

* Tue May 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: There is now a function sys.current_sessionid() to return the session
  ID of the current session.  This ID corresponds with the sessionid in
  the sys.queue() result.

* Mon May 10 2021 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: Deprecate `profilerstart` and `profilerstop` commands. Since
  stethoscope is a separate project (https://github.com/MonetDBSolutions/monetdb-pystethoscope)
  the installation directory is not standard anymore. `profilerstart` and
  `profilerstop` commands assume that the stethoscope executable is in the
  same directory as `mserver5`. This is no longer necessarily true since
  stethoscope can now be installed in a python virtual environment. The
  commands still work if stethoscope is installed using the official
  MonetDB installers, or if a symbolic link is created in the directory
  where `mserver5` is located.

* Fri May  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- odbc: A typo that made the SQLSpecialColumns function unusable was fixed.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Merge statements could not produce correct results on complex join
  conditions, so a renovation was made. As a consequence, subqueries
  now have to be disabled on merge join conditions.

* Mon May  3 2021 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: preserve in-query comments

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: The exittimeout value can now be set to a negative value (e.g. -1) to
  indicate that when stopping the dbfarm (using monetdbd stop dbfarm),
  any mserver5 processes are to be sent a termination signal and then
  waited for until they terminate.  In addition, if exittimeout is greater
  than zero, the mserver5 processes are sent a SIGKILL signal after the
  specified timeout and the managing monetdbd is sent a SIGKILL signal
  after another five seconds (if it didn't terminate already).  The old
  situation was that the managing monetdbd process was sent a SIGKILL
  after 30 seconds, and the mserver5 processes that hadn't terminated
  yet would be allowed to continue their termination sequence.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented function BUNreplacemultiincr to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, starting at a given position.
- gdk: Implemented new function BUNreplacemulti to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, at the given positions.
- gdk: Removed function BUNinplace, just use BUNreplace, and check whether
  the BAT argument is of type TYPE_void before calling if you don't
  want to materialize.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Use of CTEs inside UPDATE and DELETE statements are now more
  restrict. Previously they could be used without any extra specification
  in the query (eg. with "v1"("c1") as (...) delete from "t"
  where "t"."c1" = "v1"."c1"), however this was not conformant with the
  SQL standard. In order to use them, they must be specified in the FROM
  clause in UPDATE statements or inside a subquery.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented a function BUNappendmulti which appends an array of values
  to a BAT.  It is a generalization of the function BUNappend.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Changed the interface of the atom read function.  It now requires an
  extra pointer to a size_t value that gives the current size of the
  destination buffer, and when that buffer is too small, it receives the
  size of the reallocated buffer that is large enough.  In any case,
  and as before, the return value is a pointer to the destination buffer.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Environment variables (sys.env()) must be UTF-8, but since they can
  contain file names which may not be UTF-8, there is now a mechanism
  to store the original values outside of sys.env() and store
  %-escaped (similar to URL escaping) values in the environment.  The
  key must still be UTF-8.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: We now save the location of the min and max values when known.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Added 'schema path' property to user, specifying a list of schemas
  to be searched on to find SQL objects such as tables and
  functions. The scoping rules have been updated to support this feature
  and it now finds SQL objects in the following order:
   1. On occasions with multiple tables (e.g. add foreign key constraint,
      add table to a merge table), the child will be searched on the
      parent's schema.
   2. For tables only, declared tables on the stack.
   3. 'tmp' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
   4. Session's current schema.
   5. Each schema from the 'schema path' in order.
   6. 'sys' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
  Whenever the full path is specified, ie "schema"."object", no search will
  be made besides on the explicit schema.
- sql: To update the schema path ALTER USER x SCHEMA PATH y; statement was added.
  [SCHEMA PATH string] syntax was added to the CREATE USER statement.
  The schema path must be a single string where each schema must be between
  double quotes and separated with a single comma, e.g. '"sch1","sch2"'
  For every created user, if the schema path is not given, '"sys"' will be
  the default schema path.
- sql: Changes in the schema path won't be reflected on currently connected users,
  therefore they have to re-connect to see the change. Non existent schemas
  on the path will be ignored.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Leftover STREAM table definition from Datacell extension was removed
  from the parser. They had no effect anymore.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: By using the option "--dbextra=in-memory", mserver5 can be instructed
  to keep transient BATs completely in memory.

* Mon May 03 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- Rebuilt.
- GH#3336: DB files not removed if all rows are deleted, even after restart
- GH#7104: Monetdbe NTILE function does not produce correct ordering

  (Remote Table)

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- gdk: A bug that would very occasionally produce an error "strPut: incorrectly
  encoded UTF-8", even when no incorrectly coded characters are used
  at all, has been fixed.  It was the result of a rare combination of
  strings having been added to the column that caused essentially an
  off-by-one type of error to occur.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- merovingian: When stopping monetdbd using the `monetdbd stop' command, this command
  now waits for 5 seconds longer than the exittimeout value before it
  kills the monetdbd daemon instead of only 30 seconds total (or until
  that daemon stops earlier).  This gives the daemon enough time to
  terminate the mserver5 processes that it is managing.  If exittimeout
  is negative, the daemon and the monetdbd process initiating the stop
  wait indefinitely until the mserver5 processes have stopped.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- sql: A bug where a sequence of TRUNCATE TABLE and COPY INTO the just
  truncated table would result in success being reported to both queries,
  but the table still being empty afterwards, has been fixed.

* Fri Apr 23 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- NT: Added the monetdbe library to the Windows installer.

* Fri Apr 02 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402

* Wed Mar 31 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- odbc: When connecting using a DSN (Data Source Name), information about the
  data source is retrieved from the ODBC.INI file.  Now we also get the
  location of the LOGFILE from this file.  The logfile can be used to
  log all calls to the MonetDB ODBC driver to a file which can be used
  for debugging.

* Thu Mar 25 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- odbc: The ODBC driver now only passes on information about HUGEINT columns
  as HUGEINT when the application has indicated interest by querying
  about the SQL_HUGEINT extension type using the SQLGetTypeInfo
  function or by specifying the type in a call to SQLSetDescField.
  Otherwise the driver silently translates the HUGEINT type to BIGINT.
  This means that most application will see BIGINT columns when the
  server produced a HUGEINT column and only give an error if the value
  in the HUGEINT column didn't fit into a BIGINT.

* Thu Dec 10 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.39.9-20210111
- sql: CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER schema_name.trigger_name is now disallowed,
  because the trigger will be stored on the same schema as the table it
  refers to. Use a schema-qualified on the table reference (ie ON clause)
  when necessary.

  Instead of log(x,base), now is log(base,x).

* Thu Aug 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.1-20201006
- monetdb5: The settings for specifying how mserver5 should listen to "The
  Internet" have been overhauled.  See the manual for details.  In
  brief, mapi_autosense, mapi_ipv6 and mapi_open are gone.  If
  mapi_listenaddr equals "localhost" or "all", we listen to both IPv4
  and IPv6 (if available), if "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0", we listen to
  IPv4 only, if "::1" or "::" we listen to IPv6 only.  The first of
  each pair is loopback interface only, the second is all interfaces.
  If mapi_listenaddr is "none", then no IP port is opened, you need to
  use a UNIX domain socket.  If mapi_port is 0, we let the operating
  system choose a free port (like mapi_autosense).  Default behavior
  has not changed.

* Mon Aug 10 2020 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- MonetDB: Finished a first version of the new monitoring function
  user_statistics(), which is only intended for the DBAs.
  For each database user who has logged in during the current mserver5
  session, it returns
  "username": login name of the database user,
  "querycount": the number of queries this user has executed since his/her
      first login,
  "totalticks": the total execution time (in microsecond) of the queries ran
      by this user,
  "maxquery": the query with the longest execution time (if two queries have
      the same execution time, the newer overwrites the older),
  "maxticks": the execution time of the 'maxquery' (in microsecond),
  "started": the start timestamp of the 'maxquery',
  "finished": the finish timestamp of the 'maxquery'.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Removed compatibility between interval types and other numeric types in
  favor for a more strict SQL standard compliance. This means operations
  between temporal types and other numeric types such as INT and
  DECIMAL are no longer possible, instead use interval types.
  e.g. SELECT date '2020-01-01' + 1; now gives the error. Instead do:
  SELECT date '2020-01-01' + interval '1' day; if 1 was meant to be a
  day interval.
  Setting an interval variable such as the session's current timezone
  with a number e.g. SET current_timezone = 1; is no longer possible.
  Instead do SET current_timezone = interval '1' hour;
  Casting between interval and other numeric types is no longer possible
  as well, because they are not compatible.
- sql: Because of incompatibilities this change may create, if a user intends
  to convert a numeric value to an interval, the multiplication function
  can be used in the form: <numeric value> * interval '1' <interval length>
  e.g. 10 * interval '1' second = interval '10' second.
  As for the other way around, the 'EPOCH' option was added to the extract
  syntax. This option returns the number of milliseconds since the UNIX
  epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for date, timestamp and time values (it
  can be negative). Meanwhile, for day and second intervals, it returns the
  total number of milliseconds in the interval. As a side note, the 'EPOCH'
  option is not available for month intervals, because this conversion is
  not transparent for this type.

- sql: Removed '@' syntax used to refer into a variable in a query. It
  was a non-standard method, which was replaced by a schema addition to
  variables. Variables in the global scope now have schema. All default
  global variables are set under schema "sys". However variables
  inside PSM don't have a schema, because there are no transaction
  semantics inside PSM at the moment.
- sql: Removed declared variables and tables from the global scope. They were
  transaction agnostic and incompatible with the SQL standard, i.e. they
  are valid exclusively under PSM (e.g. functions, procedures and
  triggers).
- sql: Scoping semantics were added for both variables and tables. Variables
  with the same name at a query are now resolved under the following
  precedence rules:
    1. Tables, Views and CTEs at the FROM clause.
    2. Variable declared in the body of function/procedure, i.e. local
       variable.
    3. Function/procedure parameter.
    4. Variable from the global scope.
  Tables with the same name now have the following precedence rules at a
  SQL query:
    1. Table declared in the body of function/procedure, ie local table.
    2. Temporary table.
    3. Table from the current session schema.
  This means the query: SELECT * FROM "keys"; will list keys from
  temporary tables instead of persisted ones, because "keys" table
  is available for both "sys" and "tmp" schemas.
- sql: The table returning function "var" was extended with more details
  about globally declared variables, namely their schema, type and
  current value.

- MonetDB: The sys.queue() has been turned into a circular buffer to allow for
  inspection of both active, paused and recently executed queries.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Extended the system monitor with a table-returning function
  user_statistics() which keeps some statistics for each SQL user, e.g. the
  user's query count, total time spent, and maximal query seen.
