- Reliance on the OpenSSL library has been removed.  OpenSSL was used
  for the hash algorithms it contained (e.g. SHA512 and RIPEMD160) and
  for producing random numbers.  The hash functions have been replaced
  by the original published functions, and random numbers are generated
  using system-specific random sources (i.e. not simply pseudo-random
  number generators).
