# This file is sourced by configure and so must use shell syntax.

# Version numbers for the shared libraries that we provide
# the numbers are: <CURRENT>:<REVISION>:<AGE>
# These numbers must be changed according to the following rules
# (follow them all in order):

#   1. Update the version information only immediately before a public
#      release.
#   2. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
#      update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').
#   3. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
#      last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.
#   4. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
#      then increment AGE.
#   5. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last
#      public release, then set AGE to 0.

# In other words
# X   if there are no code changes, don't change version numbers;
# FIX if there are changes to the code (bug fixes) but no API changes,
#     just increment REVISION;
# NEW if there are only backward compatible API changes (new
#     interfaces), increment both CURRENT and AGE, and set REVISION to
#     0;
# BRK if there are also incompatible API changes (interfaces removed or
#     changed), increment CURRENT, and set AGE and REVISION to 0.
#     IMPORTANT: also change debian package names for the relevant
#     library.  This involves renaming the file in debian/ and
#     updating references to the package in debian/control.  The version
#     number should match the ELF SONAME

# the numbers are: <CURRENT>:<REVISION>:<AGE>
