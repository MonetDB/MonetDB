@* Materialized Execution Scheduling
One of the 'short commings' of the BAT storage engine is that is uses
a simplified look on the size of things. It simply maps huge files into
memory and its operators mindlessly constructs huge intermediate results.
This design decision was consciously taken. Running into such resource
limits should not be dealt with at all levels of the system, but
properly factored out to a level where better control is available.

The infrastrucuture has been stabilized enough to move ahead into
tackling these problems at the scheduler level. It is the place
where runtime information becomes available as MAL instruction
properties, e.g. the size of the the BATs being accessed.

To set the stage, consider the following MAL snippet
@example
	r:= select(R, 0, 100000);
	s:= select(S, 0, 200000);
	t:= select(s, 0,30);
	p:= prod(r,s);
	u:= f("something");
	w:= +(p,4);
	v:= sum(w);
barrier z:= count(p);
	...
@end example
Assume that after this block p is not used anymore.
To reduce resource contention a decision should be taken
at statement p. Let's look at those decisions in more detail.

If the product p is expected to become large, we have to break R and/or S
into pieces, such that their partial result satisfies our limits. 
The chopper module provides the necessary functionality for this.

If p is broken into pieces, then all the following steps in the
flowgraph towards the consumers of p should comprise of 'p-invariant'
steps and the destination of p has an incremental variant.
Likewise, between the point where the operands are broken into
pieces and consumed, it should have p-invariant statements.

The latter is easy, we simply replace the product by a nested loop
(no further optimization yet). This will ensure that the prelude 
is not affected.
@example
	r:= select(R, 0, 100000);
	s:= select(S, 0, 200000);
	t:= select(s, 0,30);
barrier (b1,rf):= chop.newChunkIterator(r,1024);
barrier (b2,sf):= chop.newChunkIterator(s,1024);
	p:= prod(rf,sf);
	u:= f("something");
	w:= +(p,4);
	v:= sum(w);
barrier z:= count(p);
	...
redo (b2,sf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(s,1024);
redo (b1,rf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(r,1024);
exit b2;
exit b1;
@end example
To make this work, the function f() should be moved out of the way,
e.g. by pushing it out of the loop, or determine it is side-effect free
with respect to p.
Moving can be done when there is no interference with the other statements. 
This property often occurs in the optimizer framework and can be checked
using the dataflow graph.

The update statement +(p,4) now also becomes dependent on 
a partial result and all code depending on it should be moved into the body
of the iteration as well.

Barrier and catch blocks are tricky. For catch blocks we should
detect if an exception could be raised on which we have to react.
End, the exception handling should have a global effect.
For barrier loops, all operations become basically partial.

The example implementation addresses only part of this problem
space. In particular, it will concentrate on plans
generated by the SQL compiler, which
have a limited operator set and relatively clean behavior.
This means we don;t have blocks to deal with and the result
of an operation is often immediately consumed.

The underlying action involves an exchange operator, which should be
aware of the nested structure of the program.

@+ The strawman's approach
The analysis of basic algebraic blocks is quite complicated, because
it effectively requires semantic knowledge of both MAL execution
and the pecularities of each (user defined) function.

An easier way out of this problem runs as follows. If p is too large
the operations in which it is used receive the information piece-wise.
This means we have to define those functions in a library anyway, because
the GDK kernel implementation does not support incremental execution.

Any occurrence of such a function call becomes the target of a rewrite
by redoing the operation p(). Conceptually the first step in the case
above is to transform it to.
@example
	r:= select(R, 0, 100000);
	s:= select(S, 0, 200000);
	t:= select(s, 0,30);
	u:= f("something");
	w:= bat(p);
barrier (b1,rf):= chop.newChunkIterator(r,1024);
barrier (b2,sf):= chop.newChunkIterator(s,1024);
	p:= prod(rf,sf);
	wi:= +(p,4);
	insert(w,wi)
redo (b2,sf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(s,1024);
redo (b1,rf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(r,1024);
exit b2;
exit b1;
	v:= sum(w);
barrier z:= count(p);
	...
@end example
Ofcourse, this rewrites does not solve the problem, because now
the accumulator bat w becomes too large and the process should
be recursively applied to its uses.
The leads to
@example
	r:= select(R, 0, 100000);
	s:= select(S, 0, 200000);
	t:= select(s, 0,30);
	u:= f("something");
	w:= bat(p);
	v:= 0;
barrier (b1,rf):= chop.newChunkIterator(r,1024);
barrier (b2,sf):= chop.newChunkIterator(s,1024);
	p:= prod(rf,sf);
	wi:= +(p,4);
	vc:= sum(wi);
	v:= v+vc;
redo (b2,sf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(s,1024);
redo (b1,rf):= chop.hasMoreChunks(r,1024);
exit b2;
exit b1;
barrier z:= count(p);
	...
@end example

The last statement should also be replaced, because
it uses a large intermediate result as well.

Since the operation v:=sum(w) could be anywhere in the
plan, we should guarantee that the repeated execution of
the iterator still produces the same result. This simply
calls for making a readonly copy of the operands going into the
product operation.

Second case.
@example
	p:= prod(r,s);
	c:= count(p);
	print(c);
	t:= select(p,X,Y);
	c:= count(t);
@end example
@+ Optimization issues
Once a target operation has been isolated for chopping it up
into a loop, it becomes mandatory to find an optimal choice.
This could be focussed on minimizing the number of loop steps
up to minimizing the total footprint of its body.
The latter seems identical to the knapsack problem and too
expensive to consider in our setting. 

The first rule to apply is to maximize the volume covered in each
step, which means you find fragment size P and Q, such that 
|r|x|s|/(PxQ) is minimized and still fits the resources provided,
e.g. the system cache.
This under the global constraint to leave room for the body to work, which
could be determined  calculating the maximum volume needed.
(is a separate scheduler support routine)

The strawman's approach is a classical exchange of storage for
cpu cycles. It is used as our first implementation under the
assumption the need for chopping the same operand twice is a rare event.
The simplicity of the algorithm makes the optimizer much faster and less
error prone.

@+ Preliminary results.
The test suite contains a simple test (tst950) that measures
the gross impact of this process. It aims at a cross-product
of 16Kx16K bats. In M4 this could not be accomodated due to memory
consumption.
@+ Implementation focus
The first implementation of this optimizer is geared at instructions
produced by the SQL front-end.
See for SQL specific optimization rules the corresponding source code,
called sql_optimizer.

The cross operator is by large the most 'dangerous', because its
potential claim on memory is huge.
Replacing it with an iterator version avoids materialization of
this intermediate, before it is being consumed by the other
operators.

A critical issue is to respect the resources available.
This will be collected at the start of the scheduler call
and is available as global information.
