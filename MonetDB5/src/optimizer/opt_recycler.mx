@- The recycler
Query optimization and processing in off-the-shelf database systems is often
still focussed on individual queries. The queries are analysed in isolation
and ran against a kernel regardless opportunities offered by concurrent or
previous invocations.

This approach is far from optimal and two directions to improve
are explored: materialized views and (partial) result-set reuse.
Materialized views are derived from query logs. They represent
common sub-queries, whose materialization improves
subsequent processing times.
Re-use of (partial) results is used in those cases where a
zooming-in or navigational application is at stake.

The Recycler optimizer and module extends this with a middle out approach.
They exploits the materialize-all-intermediate approach of MonetDB
by deciding to keep a hold on them as long as deemed benificial.

The approach taken is to mark the variables in a MAL program
using the recycler optimizer call, such that their result is retained
in a global recycle cache hardwired in the MAL interpreter.
Instructions become subject to the Recycler if
at least one of its arguments is a BAT and all others are
either constants or variables already known in the Recycler.

Upon execution, the recycler is called from the innerloop
of the MAL interpreter to first check for
an up-to-date result to be picked up at no cost.
Otherwise, it evaluates the instruction and calls upon
policy functions to decide if it is worthwhile to keep.

The Recycler comes with a few policy controlling operators
to experiment with its effect in concrete settings.
The retain policy controls when to keep results around,o
the reuse policy looks after exact duplicate instructions
or uses semantic knowledge on MAL instructions to detect
potential reuse gain (e.g. reuse select results).
And finally, the cache policy looks after the storage space for the 
intermediate result pool.
The details are described in the recycle module @ref{}.

The variables are all checked for being eligible as a variable
subject to recycling control. A variable my only be assigned
a value once. The function is an sql.bind() or all arguments
are already recycle enabled or constant.

The arguments of the function can not be recycled.
They change with each called. This does not mean
that the instructions using them can not be a
target of recycling.

Just looking at a kept result target is not good enough.
You have to sure that the arguments are also the same.
This outrules function arguments.

The expected gain is largest if we can re-use selections
on the base tables in SQL. These, however, are marked as
uselect() calls, which only produces the oid head.
For cheap types we preselect using select() and re-map uselect() back 
over this temporary.
For the time being for all possible selects encountered
are marked for re-use.
(keeping track of the sql.bind() dependency is more work)
@c
		/* take care of semantic driven recyling */
		if( getFunctionId(p)== selectRef )
			p->recycle = 1;
		if( getFunctionId(p)== uselectRef &&
			!ATOMvarsized( getGDKType( getArgType(mb,p,1)))
		){
			q= copyInstruction(p);
			getArg(q,0)= newTmpVariable(mb,TYPE_any);
			setFunctionId(q, selectRef);
			q->recycle = 1;
			pushInstruction(mb,q);
			getArg(p,1)= getArg(q,0);
			setFunctionId(p,markTRef);
			p->argc=2;
			p->recycle = 1;
		}
		if( p->token== ENDsymbol)
			q= newFcnCall(mb,"recycle","epilogue");
