@* Cracker index

Database cracking aims at enhancing query processing by adapting the way 
data is stored to the query workload. Adaptation happens through physical 
reorganization of data. Each query reorganized the data in such a way that 
future queries can be answered faster.

For each BAT b, the system creates on demand a cracker column c, i.e., 
the first time a select operator is fired on b. From there on all queries that 
perform a select operator on b will physically reorganize (i.e., crack) the cracker column c 
such that the result set is in a consecutive area in c. 
The result of the select operator is a non materialized view on c.

For each cracker column c, there exists a cracker index, that maintains knowledge 
on the various pieces created while cracking c. The cracker index is an AVLt-tree
data structure. Each select operator uses the appropriate cracker index to determine 
which pieces it should crack, and updates the index afterwards.

The more queries are fired on a bat b the more the cracker column c of b is cracked.
This way the cracker index on c, is continuously enriched with information that helps speed up 
future queries. This way query processing improves as more queries are answered by adapting to 
the query and data workload.

Initial performance shows an exptected gain of at least on order of magnitude, 
due to analysing less data during the select operator and also due to non materializing 
the select operator result set.

The cracker index can be created for the time being on
tail columns of type {int,lng,dbl,flt,time,date,sht}. The head
is always of type @sc{oid}.

In addition, the cracker index can be used to feed a generator
for pieces satisfying a range constraint.
A cracker partition is indicated by the index in the cidx
table. It can be used to initialize a BATview to represent
the partition during processing.

Updates support for cracker columns happens again in a self-organizing way.
Incoming updates (inserts,deletes or updates) are kept in separate columns for 
each BAT as pending updates. While processing queries, if the crackers select 
operator detects that some of the pending updates should be taken into account,
then updates are "merged" into the cracker column on the fly by also updating the 
cracker index accordingly.

Since the cracker columns are physically reorganized the result of a select operator is not 
ordered in the same way as the rest of the bats of the same relation. This has side-effects 
during projection operations. We cannot use ordered fetch joins anymore. 
This decrades performance significantly
when multiple projections exist in a query plan.

This problem is solved by the second generation cracing, i.e., 
sideways cracking that uses cracker maps instead of cracker columns.
A cracker map contains the values of two attributes of the same relation. 
These are attributes used together in query plans. The main idea is that 
cracking based on one of these attributes (the head of the map) is forwarded on the tail. 
This way projections can be performed by performing simple cracking operations on maps.
Multiple maps can exist for each attribute A as head consisting the map set of A. All maps in the same 
map set S are aligned before used in a query plan. Aligment happens by keeping a history of all cracking 
operations in maps of S and ensuring that the same cracks have been applied to all necessary maps 
and in the same order. Sideways cracking maintains the advantage of cracking even 
in the presence of multiple projection operations.

Ongoing work.
Multitable cracking.

The cracker module should be prepared to deal with any of the base types.
For strings this becomes an issue.

The current implementation uses an unprotected cracker
index. This limits the interface at slightly more overhead
of searching the cracker index upon each call.

Currently crakcer structures are in memory. They need to be stored in disk and become persistent.

Repeated cracking leads to an ever growing index. This process
can be stopped by setting the granule size,
i.e.  the minimum number of tuples in each piece,
or the maximum number of pieces.

The implementation is geared at early experimentation
without all the details to make the code robust and
ultra fast.
