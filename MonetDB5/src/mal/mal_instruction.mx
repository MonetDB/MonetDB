@* MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL)
The primary textual interface to the Monetdb kernel
is a simple, assembly-like language, called MAL. 
The language reflects the virtual machine architecture around the
kernel libraries and has been designed for speed of parsing,
ease of analysis, and ease of target compilation by query compilers.
The language is not meant as a primary programming language,
or scripting language. Such use is even discouraged.

Furthermore, a MAL program is considered a specification
of intended computation and data flow behavior. It should be
understood that its actual evaluation depends on the execution
paradigm choosen in a scenario. The program blocks can both
be interpreted as ordered sequences of assembler instructions,
or as a representation of a data-flow graph that should be resolved
in a dataflow driven manner.
The language syntax uses a functional style definition of actions and
mark those that affect the flow explicitly.
Flow of control keywords identify a point to chance
the interpretation paradigm and denote a synchronization point.

MAL is the target language for query compilers, such as the
SQL and XQuery front-ends. 
Even simple SQL queries generate a long sequence of MAL instructions.
They represent both the administrative actions to ensure binding and transaction
control, the flow dependencies to produce the query result,
and the steps needed to prepare the result set for delivery to
the front-end.

Only when the algebraic structure is too limited (e.g. updates),
or the database back-end lacks feasible builtin bulk operators,
one has to rely on more detailed flow of control primitives.
But even in that case, the basic blocks to be processed
by a MAL back-end are considered large, e.g. tens of simple
bulk assignment instructions.

The remainder of this chapter provide a concise overview of the
language features and illustrative examples.

@+ MAL Literals 
Literals in MAL follow the lexical conventions of the programming
language C.
A default type is attached, e.g. the literal 1 is typed
as an @sc{int} value.
Likewise, the literal 3.14 is typed @sc{flt} rather than @sc{dbl}.

A literal can be coerced to another type by tagging it with a type
classifier, provided a coercion operation is defined.
For example, @sc{1:lng} marks the literal as of type @sc{lng}.
and @sc{"1999-12-10":date} creates a @sc{date} literal.

MonetDB comes with the hardwired types @sc{bit, bte, chr, wrd, sht, int, lng, oid, flt, 
dbl, str} and @sc{bat}, the bat identifier.
The kernel code has been optimized to deal with these types efficiently,
i.e. without unnecessary function call overheads.
In addition,  the system supports
temporal types @sc{date, daytime, time, timestamp, timezone},
extensions to deal with IPv4 addresses and URLs using @sc{inet, url},
and several types to interact more closely with the 
kernel @sc{lock, semphore}.
This list can be extended with user defined types.

@node MAL Variables, MAL Instructions, MAL Literals, MAL Reference
@+ MAL Variables
Variables are denoted by identifers and
implicitly defined upon first use. They take
on a type through a type classifier or inherit it from
the context in which they are first used, see @ref{MAL Type System}. 

Variables are organized into two classes, starting with and without
an underscore. The latter are reserved as MAL parser tempoaries, 
whose name aligns with an entry in the symbol table.
In general they can not be used in MAL programs, but they may become
visible in MAL program listings or during debugging.

@node MAL Instructions, MAL Flow-of-control, MAL Variables, MAL Reference
@+ Instructions
A MAL instruction has purposely a simple format. 
It is syntactically represented by an assignment, where
an expression (function call) delivers results to multiple target variables. 
The assignment patterns recognized are illustrated below.
@example
(t1,..,t32) := module.fcn(a1,..,a32);
t1 := module.fcn(a1,..,a32);
t1 := v1 operator v2;
t1 := literal;
(t1,..,tn) := (a1,..,an);
@end example

Operators are grouped into user defined modules.
Ommission of the module name is interpreter as the @sc{user} module.

Simple binary arithmetic operations are merely provided as a short-hand,
e.g. the expression @sc{t:=2+2} is converted directly 
into @sc{t:= calc.+(2,2)}.

Target variables are optional. The compiler introduces temporary 
variables to hold the result of the expression upon need. 
They won't show up when you list the MAL program unless it
is used elsewhere.

For parsing simplicity, each instruction fits on a single line.
Comments start with a sharp '#' and continues to the end of the line.
They are retained in the internal code representation to ease
debugging of compiler generated MAL programs.

The data structure to represent a MAL block is kept simple.
It contains a sequence of MAL statements and a symbol table.
The MAL instruction record is a code byte string overlaid with the
instruction pattern, which contains references into the symbol tables
and administrative data for the interpreter. 

This method leads to a large allocated block, which can be easily freed.
Variable- and statement- block together describe the
static part of a MAL procedure. It carries enough 
information to produce a listing and to aid symbolic debugging.

@node MAL Flow-of-control, MAL Functions, MAL Instructions, MAL Reference
@+ MAL Flow-of-control
The flow of control within a MAL program block can be changed by
tagging a statement with either @sc{return}, @sc{yield},
@sc{barrier}, @sc{catch}, @sc{leave}, @sc{redo}, or @sc{exit}.

The flow modifiers @sc{return} and @sc{yield} mark the end
of a call and return one or more results to the calling environment.
The @sc{return} and @sc{yield} are followed by a target list
or an assignment, which is executed first.

The @sc{barrier} (@sc{catch}) and @sc{exit} pair mark a
guarded statement block. They may be nested to form a proper
hierarchy identified by their primary target variable,
also called the control variable.

The @sc{leave} and @sc{redo} are conditional flow modifiers.
The control variable is used after the assignment statement has
been evaluated to decide on the flow-of-control action to be taken.
Built-in controls exists for booleans and numeric values.
The barrier block is opened when the control variable holds
true, when its numeric value >= 0, or when it is a non-empty
string. The @sc{nil} value blocks entry in all cases.

Once inside the barrier you have an option to prematurely
@sc{leave} it at the exit statement
or to @sc{redo} interpretation just after the corresponding
barrier statement. Much like 'break' and 'continue' statements
in the programming language C.
The action is taken when the condition is met.

The @sc{exit} marks the exit for a block. Its optional assignment
can be used to re-initialize the barrier control variables
or wrap-up any related administration.

The barrier blocks can be properly nested to form
a hierarchy of basic blocks.
The control flow within and between blocks is
simple enough to deal with during an optimizer stage.
The @sc{redo} and @sc{leave} statements mark
the partial end of a block. Statements within these
blocks can be re-arranged according to the data-flow
dependencies. The order of partial blocks can not
be changed that easily. It depends on the mutual
exclusion of the data flows within each partial block.

Common guarded blocks in imperative languages are
the for-loop and if-then-else constructs.
They can be simulated as follows.

Consider the statement @sc{for(i=1;i<10;i++) print(i)}.
The (optimized) MAL block to implement this becomes:
@example
     i:= 1;
barrier B:= i<10;
     io.print(i);
     i:= i+1;
redo B:= i<10;
exit B;
@end example

Translation of the statement @sc{if(i<1) print("ok"); else print("wrong");}
becomes:
@example
    i:=1;
barrier ifpart:= i<1;
    io.print("ok");
exit ifpart;
barrier elsepart:= i>=1;
    io.print("wrong");
exit elsepart;
@end example

Note that both guarded blocks can be interchanged without
affecting the outcome. Moreover, neither block would
have been entered if the variable happens to be assigned @sc{nil}.

The primitives are sufficient to model a wide variety of iterators,
whose pattern look like:
@example
barrier i:= M.newIterator(T);
    elm:= M.getElement(T,i);
    ...
    leave i:= M.noMoreElements(T);
    ...
    redo i:= M.hasMoreElements(T);
exit i:= M.exitIterator(T);
@end example
The semantics obeyed by the iterator implementations is as follows.
The redo expression updates the target variable @emph{ i} and control
proceeds at the first statement after the barrier when the
barrier is opened by @emph{ i}. If the barrier could not be
re-opened, execution proceeds with the first statement after
the redo.
Likewise, the leave control statement skips to the exit
when the control variable @emph{ i} shows a closed barrier block.
Otherwise, it continues with the next instruction.
Note, in both failed cases the control variable is
possibly changed.

A recurring situation is to iterate over the elements in
a BAT. This is supported by an iterator implementation for BATs
as follows:
@example
barrier (idx,hd,tl):= bat.newIterator(B);
    ...
    redo (idx,hd,tl):= bat.hasMoreElements(B);
exit (ids,hd,tl);
@end example
Where idx is an integer to denote the row in the BAT,
hd and tl denote values of the current element.
@{
@+ The MAL instruction records
The data structure to represent a MAL block is kept simple.
It carries a sequence of MAL statements and a variable table.
Each instruction contains references to elements in the
symbol table.

The MAL instruction is a code byte string overlaid with the
instruction pattern. This method leads to a large
allocated block, which can be easily freed, and
pattern makes it possible to accommodate a variable argument list.

Variable- and stmt- block together describe the
static part of a MAL procedure. It carries carry enough
information to produce
a listing and to aid symbolic debugging.

Ideally, the listing of a MAL program is identical to the source.
This costs some space, but will improve readability and permits
instruction sequences generated internally also to be kept
around as ASCII text for later inclusion.

WARNING. The way we lay out the instructions means that
you can prepare only one instruction at a time, because you don't
know how many arguments may be needed upfront.
[TODO, rather then breaking the original input into pieces,
it would be worthwhile to keep track of location of the
instruction in the source.]

The resetMalBlk code removes instructions, but without freeing

illegal re-use of a MAL blk.

The MalBlk structures potentially consume a lot a of space, because it
is not possible to precisely estimate the default sizes of the var and stmt
components. The routines below provide a mechanism to handle the issue.
The expandMalBlk routine takes the number of new-lines as a parameter
and guesses the size of variable and statement table.

Experience shows that trimming leads to memory fragmentation (140K lost
after server init) and is therefore turned off.

@-
Before compiling a large string, it makes sense to allocate approximately
enough space to keep the intermediate code. Otherwise, we end up with a
repeated extend on the MAL block, which really consumes a lot of memcpy
resources.
The average MAL string length could been derived from the
test cases. An error in the estimate is more expensive than
just counting the lines.

The MAL blocks act as instruction pools.
Using a resetMALblock makes the instructions available.
@c

@-
Query optimizers walk their way through a MAL program block.
They require some primitives to move instructions around and
to remove superflous instructions.
The removal is based on the assumption that indeed the instruction
belonged to the block.

@-
Beware that the first argument of a signature is reserved for the function
return type , which should be equal to the destination variable type.

VarRecords are allocated on the variable stack.
Their index is returned for future reference.
@-
Use the information that a variable is at least one character
wide and terminated by a null-byte.
This means that we can speed up search when the variables
differ in the first two characters

Furthermore, temporary variables are already assigned to a specific
position in the variable table. This information can only be used
under the assumption that the code base is not modified on the
fly. Then the expensive search is started anyway.
It also means that input which does not comply with the intended
location of a temporary variable should be flagged as an error.

The second version of findVariable assumes you have not
yet allocated a private structure. This is particularly
usefull during parsing, because most variables are already
defined. This way we safe GDKmalloc/GDKfree.

Note that getType also checks for type names directly.
They have preference over variable names.

@-
All variables are implicitly declared upon their first assignment.

Lexical constants require some care. They typically appear as arguments
in operator/function calls. To simplify program analysis later on,
we stick to the situation that function/operator arguments are always
references to by variables.

@+ MAL variables
Temporary target variable act as sinks in the data flow graph.
In this case, an optimizer can group them by underlying type and this way
reduce the symbol table size significantly.

MAL variables are internally represented by their index into
the variable stack. Their default textual representation is '_'<digits>.
Temporary names  are recognized by the parser and an error is
produced if it does not satisfy this condition.

Sharing of the temporary is only permitted if the type
is a priory known and not TYPE_any.

@+ MAL constants
Constants are stored in the symbol table and referenced
by a variable identifier.
This means that per MAL instruction, we may end up with
MAXARG entries in the symbol table. This may lead to long
searches for variables.
An optimization strategy deployed in the current
implementation is to look around for
a similar (constant) definition and to reuse its identifier.
This avoids an exploding symbol table with a lot
of temporary variables (as in tst400cHuge)

But then the question becomes how far to search?
Searching through all variables is only useful when the list remains short
or when the constant-variable-name is easily derivable from its literal
value and a hash-based index leads you quickly to it.

For the time being, we use a MAL system parameter, MAL_VAR_WINDOW,
to indicate the number of symbol table entries to consider.
Setting it to >= MAXARG will at least capture repeated use of a constant
within a single function call or repeated use within a small block
of code.

The final step is to prepare a GDK value record, from which
the internal representation can be obtained during
MAL interpretation.

The constant values are linked together to improve searching them.
This start of the constant list is kept in the MalBlk.

Conversion of a constant to another type is limited to
well-known coercion rules. Errors are reported and the
nil value is set.
