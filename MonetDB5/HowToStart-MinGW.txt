How To Start with MonetDB5--MinGW Version
========================================

.. This document is written in reStructuredText (see
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for more information).
   Use ``rst2html.py`` to convert this file to HTML.

It is possible to compile MonetDB5 using `MinGW`__ (Minimalist GNU for
Windows) on Windows.  This uses the GNU C compiler ``gcc`` to produce
code which does not depend on any extra .DLLs.

__ http://www.mingw.org/

There are basically two ways in which you can use the MinGW compiler.
The first is by installing the tools directly from the MinGW website,
including the MSYS tools; and the second is by using the Cygwin__
tools.  Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows.

__ http://www.cygwin.com/

I have used the latter method and that method is described in this
document.  The main reason for this is that the Cygwin tools are more
up-to-date.  Especially the bison parser generator is newer than what
is available from the MinGW site.  Also, some of the required tools
are missing from the MinGW site and would have to be built separately.

This document does not address the issue of how to install the Cygwin
tools.

Some of the Cygwin packages that are required to build MonetDB5 (and
the other projects) are::

 gcc-mingw-core
 mingw-runtime
 w32api

and optionally::

 mingw-bzip2
 mingw-zlib

In addition to Cygwin, we also need the Pthreads library compiled for
Native Windows.  It can be found at
ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/.

Download the archive (the latest version we have tried is
``pthreads-w32-2-7-0-release.exe``) and extract it.  Pthreads should
be installed to ``C:\Pthreads``, so copy the contents of the
``prebuilt`` or ``Pre-built.2`` folder from the extracted archive to
``C:\Pthreads`` (so that you end up with folders ``C:\Pthreads\lib``
and ``C:\Pthreads\include``).  Don't use spaces in the name of the
folder where you install the Pre-built files.

For information about compiling the optional PCRE library, see the
file `HowToStart-MinGW-pcre.txt`__.

For information about using the optional SWIG tool, see the file
`HowToStart-MinGW-swig.txt`__.

In order to compile and install MonetDB5, I use the following commands::

 ./bootstrap
 mkdir MinGW
 cd MinGW
 ../configure --host=i386-pc-mingw32 \
              CC='gcc -mwin32 -mno-cygwin' \
              --with-translatepath='cygpath -w' \
              --with-pthread=C:/Pthreads \
              --without-iconv \
              --without-pcre \
              --without-php \
              --without-swig \
              --prefix="$HOME/MinGW"
 make
 make install

As with the other ways of compiling MonetDB5, compiling MonetDB5 with
MinGW uses Mx and mel.  These packages (from the buildtools module of
the MonetDB5 CVS repository) need to be compiled for Cygwin and need to
be installed in a directory in $PATH.  Alternatively, it is possible
to use the --with-mx=.../Mx.exe and --with-mel=.../mel.exe options to
configure to specify where these binaries are located.  Mx and mel are
not needed when building from a source distribution (i.e. a ``.tar.gz``
file from SourceForge).

???It is essential that the path to the configure script does not
contain any spaces.

If you do have PCRE installed and want to use it, use
--with-pcre=... instead of the --without-pcre option.

If you do have Swig installed and want to use it, use
--with-swig=... instead of the --without-swig option.

In order to run the resulting binary, a number of folders need to be
added to the Windows PATH::

 rem as an abbreviation, set MONETDB5_PREFIX to the Windows version of
 rem the folder where MonetDB5 was installed
 set MONETDB5_PREFIX=...\MinGW
 set PATH=C:\Pthreads\lib;%PATH%
 set PATH=%MONETDB5_PREFIX%\lib\MonetDB5;%PATH%
 set PATH=%MONETDB5_PREFIX%\lib\bin;%PATH%
 set PATH=%MONETDB5_PREFIX%\lib;%PATH%
 set PATH=%MONETDB5_PREFIX%\bin;%PATH%

If bz2 and z are included in the compilation (i.e. the libraries were
found in the configure step), the Cygwin bin directory also needs to
be added.  Only the mgwbz2-1.dll and mgwz.dll are used from that
folder.  We add the folder at the end of the Windows search path::

 set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin

You can now test the MonetDB5 installation using the following command::

 rem as an abbreviation, set MNSRC to the (Windows name of) the
 rem MonetDB5 source folder, also note that per the above,
 rem %MNSRC%\MinGW is (the Windows name of) the folder in which
 rem MonetDB5 was built.
 set MNSRC=...\MonetDB5
 rem the following command should be on a single line
 cd "%MNSRC%"
 Mtest.py --TSTSRCBASE="%MNSRC%" --TSTBLDBASE="%MNSRC%\MinGW" --TSTTRGBASE="%MONETDB5_PREFIX%" -r
