monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
    This is mainy for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can now be
    built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".
    Files that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
    "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on Windows,
    requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
    getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably) requiring a
    rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented build directory support for Windows,
    i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
    build directory as alternative to ...<package>NT, and thus keep the
    latter clean from files generated during the build.
    On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...<package>NT .

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * The MAL debugger list command has been extended with
    an optional hash '#', which produces line numbers for
    each of reference and analysis of variable span.
  * The dataflow scheduler has been revamped to allow for
    more parellelism to be exploited.
  * The garbage collection administration has been changed. Every variable record
    now comes with an end-of-life field (eolife), which denotes the instruction whereafter
    the BAT variable reference counter can be decremented. The garbage collector is
    never called automagically on MAL functions, because there may be other
    pressing needs to retain them. This means that MAL functions defined and
    used in the context of SQL, and which are not inlined, may cause a leakage.
    The garbage collection has become part of each interpreter step.
    The new approach makes the SQL/MAL plans half te size as before.

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed stethoscope from MonetDB5 sources.  New location is in the
    clients repository.

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the compression optimizer as an example of how to gain access to
    foreign file formats deep down in the kernel and transfer them just
    in time into a temporary BAT.

 -- Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl>  Tue, 20 Apr 2010 10:58:37 +0200

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed configure argument --with-console to --enable-console.
    Default remains console being enabled.

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed cleaning the user module context upon session end.
    Fixes bug #2956664

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * The config variable mapi_usock can now be used to instruct the server
    to listen for connections on a local UNIX domain socket on UNIX-like
    systems.

monetdb5-server (5.20.1-20100618) unstable; urgency=low

  * The MAL interpreter has been extended with an operation
    admission policy to control the memory claims of all
    concurrent running interpreters. Instructions are hold
    up unto there is sufficient resource or the query plan
    can not avoid its execution anymore.
  * The join path optimizer has been extended with searching for
    join*, semijoin*, and leftjoin* paths. Furthermore, it avoids
    duplicate work by factoring out all common simple join paths.

monetdb5-server (5.18.3-20100322) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a race condition that could occur if many clients were connecting
    and disconnecting.

  * Rebuilt.

monetdb5-server (5.18.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * The MonetDB 5 code base underwent a series of small/medium changes:
    - Solving name conflicts with external libraries in mal_box.
    - Dependency graph generation in MAL debugger fixed.
    - Code hardening against out of memory errors and based on Coverity checks.
    - Recycler improved to deal with SQL plans from different sessions.
    - Profiler extended to report the argument types, user, and thread id.
    - MAL interpreter reports an event before and after the instruction.
    - Dataflow also allowed for updates on temporary BATs.
    - Reorder optimizer better respects the dataflow.
    - All update instructions return their target to mark the dataflow.
    - Clean up of (bat)calc module.
    - Packing pieces together simplified and speed up.
  * The MAL interpreter has been extended with an operator admission scheme, which is
    active during parallel execution. It blocks threads if the total amount of memory
    needed for the operator can not be claimed. Only if there is one operation
    left to execute, it won't block. The admission level is controlled by
    a threshold, which is set to 90% of the physical memory.

monetdb5-server (5.18.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * The ilike[u]select operations has been included in the repertoire
    recognized by the mergetable optimizer for push through of selections.
  * The joinpath optimizer has been extended with recognition of the leftjoin.
    This way, series of leftjoin operations can be optimized by looking at
    the smallest starting point.
  * Introduced a dictionary encoding option to the optimizer pipeline.
    Encoding is initiated with a SQL call compress(tablename).

monetdb5-server (5.18.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the ability to redirect to other running databases in the same
    dbfarm.  This functionality has been taken over completely by
    merovingian, and only results in confusement these days, bug #2891191.
  * Added --enable-console configure argument, defaulting to 'yes' for
    now.  Disabling the server console increases security by avoiding
    local access exploits.  This is not the default since our Testing
    setup cannot deal with a console-less server yet.
