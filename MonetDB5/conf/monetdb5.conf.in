# Configuration file for MonetDB Version 5 server

# The configuration file is an integral part of a database store
# and aimed to initialize the server and service components.
# This startup file is read by the GDK kernel to set system wide parameters.

# It may be inspected by application/scripts for specific settings,
# but such client side configurations are better packed in their
# own structure.


# Absolute path where MonetDB is installed

# GDK Section
#============
# All databases are stored as a directory under the directory
# given below.  Use this value to change the overall location
# of your data.
gdk_dbfarm=@localstatedir@@DIRSEP@MonetDB5@DIRSEP@dbfarm

# MonetDB can only handle one database at a time.  When you start an
# mserver5 manually without specifying the database name yourself, the
# following database name is used.
#gdk_dbname=demo


# Monet Section
#==============
# monet_admin=adm			#administrator user name
# Prompt when using MAL interface
# monet_prompt=>
# Where do the MonetDB modules reside? The second path is for windows dlls.

# Where is the file that stores the secret key to unlock the password
# vault?  The file is read up to the first null-byte ('\0'), so you can
# padd the file with trailing null-bytes to obfuscate the key length.
# You can easily generate some key by running pwgen and adding a few of
# the passwords generated.  Make sure not to make the key too small.
# If you leave this unset, some default key is used.
# Note: changing this key for an existing database makes that database
# unusable as noone is any longer able to login.
# If you use Merovingian, a per-database vault key is used and this
# setting ignored.
#monet_vault_key=@sysconfdir@@DIRSEP@monetdb.secret


# Merovingian section
#====================
# Merovingian logs messages and errors by default to the stdout and
# stderr channels on the console.  By setting one or both of the
# variables below, one can specify messages and/or errors to be logged
# to a file instead.  It is legitimate to have both mero_msglog and
# mero_errlog pointing to the same file, as in the default below.
# Setting mero_msglog and/or mero_errlog to the empty string, results in
# merovingian to log to the screen.
#mero_msglog=@localstatedir@@DIRSEP@log@DIRSEP@MonetDB@DIRSEP@merovingian.log
#mero_errlog=@localstatedir@@DIRSEP@log@DIRSEP@MonetDB@DIRSEP@merovingian.log
#
# Merovingian forks itself to detach into the background.  It stores its
# pid in the following file, which can be used to stop Merovingian
# again.
mero_pidfile=@localstatedir@@DIRSEP@run@DIRSEP@MonetDB@DIRSEP@merovingian.pid
#
# In normal use, Merovingian replaces an mserver, and hence listens for
# connections on the same port as an mserver would do (mapi_port).  For
# certain configs, however, it may be more suitable to use an alternate
# port, which can be specified here.
#mero_port=50000
#
# mservers that were started by Merovingian are shut down when the
# Merovingian is shut down.  This behaviour is desirable if the
# Merovingian is ran as daemon process that represents MonetDB, such as
# in an init.d script.  Setting the time-out value below to a positive
# non-zero value will shut down each mserver that was started with a
# given time-out in seconds.  If the time-out expires, the mserver is
# killed using the SIGKILL signal.  A time-out value of 0 means that no
# mserver is shut down, meaning they will live on after the Merovingian
# has shut down.  The default is to shut down all started mservers with
# a time-out of 60 seconds.
#mero_exittimeout=60
#
# Merovingian has two ways in which it can "attach" a connecting client
# to the target database.  The first method uses a redirect to the
# responsible mserver process, the second method proxies the client to
# the mserver over Merovingian.  While the first is more efficient, it
# requires the connecting client to be able to connect to the mserver.
# In many settings this may be undesirable or even impossible, since
# a wide range of open ports are necessary for this.  In such case the
# proxy behaviour of Merovingian is a good solution, which also allows a
# Merovingian on the border of a network to serve requests to nodes in
# the local (unreachable) network.  Hence, proxy mode is the default.
# Uncomment the value below to use the first method of using redirects.
# Note that Merovingian will use an efficient method to connect the
# client with a local target database when proxy mode is active.  This
# method is performance wise equal to forwarding, but completely hides
# the actual way of connecting to the target database, like proxying.
#mero_doproxy=no
#
# Neighbour discovery allows Merovingian to discover other running
# Merovingian processes in the local network.  Merovingian publishes
# locally available databases to others periodically.  The interval used
# here depends on the time-to-live of the databases before they need to
# get refreshed.  The default is 10 minutes, which should keep traffic
# in your network fairly low.  Additions and removals are processed
# immediately regardless of this timeout.  If you are in a network
# environment where links disappear often, you may want to decrease this
# value to more quickly remove no longer reachable databases.
#mero_discoveryttl=600
#
# Neighbour discovery is done using UDP broadcasts on the port set by
# mero_discoveryport.  It's value defaults to the value of mero_port,
# which usually is 50000.  Setting this value to 0 disables the
# neighbour discovery service entirely.
#mero_discoveryport=50000
#
# Each Merovingian can be controlled by monetdb(1).  By default,
# Merovingian binds to a local UNIX domain socket which allows a local
# monetdb(1) to connect based on the UNIX file system permissions.
# Merovingian can also listen on a TCP socket to serve requests from a
# monetdb(1) elsewhere.  If mero_controlport is set, Merovingian listens
# to that port for remote control commands.  This is an all or nothing
# scenario, hence any remote monetdb(1) can create, destroy, etc.  As a
# little protective measure, the file
# @localstatedir@@DIRSEP@MonetDB5@DIRSEP@dbfarm@DIRSEP@.merovingian_pass
# contains the passphrase that a remote monetdb(1) needs to issue to be
# able to perform any command.  For this file the same rules hold as for
# the monet_vault_key file.  If this file is missing, Merovingian will
# attempt to create it with a random password.  If the file cannot be
# opened for some reason, Merovingian will not start.
mero_controlport=50001

# SQL Interface Section
#======================
# The SQL debug level (should be disabled for normal use)
# sql_debug=0

# The default SQL optimizer pipeline can be set per server.  See the
# optpipe setting in monetdb(1) when using merovingian.  During SQL
# initialization, the optimizer pipeline is checked against the
# dependency information maintained in the optimizer library to ensure
# there are no conflicts and at least the pre-requisite optimizers are
# used.  The setting of sql_optimizer can be either the list of
# optimizers to run, or one or more variables containing the optimizer
# pipeline to run.  The latter is provided for readability purposes
# only.
