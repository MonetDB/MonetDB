The Monet Database System
=========================

The Monet database is developed by the CWI database research group 
(see http://monetdb.cwi.nl).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at http://sourceforge.net/projects/monetdb

The Monet database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB kernel works together with an
SQL frontend that is in a separate CVS module.

If you got a source distribution, please compile and install MonetDB
first, following the instructions in the file 'HowToStart' (for Unix) or
'HowToStart-Win32.txt' (for Windows).

The documentation starts in doc/MonetDB.html, relative from your binary
distribution top-level directory, or installation directory (once you
compiled and installed the source distribution).
