@subsection Aqua Data Studio
Aqua Data Studio is a graphical user interface to interact with MonetDB/SQL.
It is available on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms from  the
@url{http://www.aquafold.com, distribution} site.
Download the Version 4.5  executable and install the software.

The first step to make Aqua Data Studio aware of MonetDB is to register 
the database server .
Go to the @code{Server->Register Server} panel and select
the Generic- JDBC RDBMS theme.
It requires the following additional field settings:
@multitable @columnfractions 0.15 0.8
@item Name: 
@tab MonetDB SQL
@item Type:
@tab @emph{ Whatever you want}
@item Login Name:
@tab monetdb	
@item Password:
@tab monetdb 
@item URL
@tab jdbc:monetdb://localhost/database
@item Driver:
@tab nl.cwi.monetdb.jdbc.MonetDriver
@item Driver Location:
@tab C:\Program Files\CWI\MonetDB\share\MonetDB\lib\monetdb-1.4-jdbc.jar
@end multitable

The location of the JDBC driver under Linux and OSX is
by default /usr/share/MonetDB/lib/monetdb-1.4-jdbc.jar.

Once the settings has been completed, start the MonetDB server
and try to connect.
If necessary extend the heap size of your java engine, e.g.
use -Xmx1024M .

Consult your system administrator if other
MonetDB user creditials and locality settings are required.
