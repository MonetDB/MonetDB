* Wed Jan 29 2025 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.53.1-20250317
- msettings can now be allocated with a custom memory allocator using
  msettings_create_with() and msettings_clone_with().  This is used in
  the SQL module to allocate them using the arena allocator.
- The msettings objects no longer keep track of 'ignored' settings.
  Function msetting_set_ignored has been removed.
- Function msetting_as_string() has been changed to never return a newly
  allocated string.  To make this possible the user now has to pass in
  a small scratch buffer that will be used if the setting is a number.
  (booleans and strings can use existing strings).
- Functions msettings_parse_url() and msettings_validate() have been
  modified to return any error message instead of setting it through a
  pointer parameter.
- Function msettings_write_url() has been added to render an msettings
  object as a URL string.

* Wed Jun 19 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.51.1-20240812
- Add new columns to sys.sessions. Column 'language' is usually 'sql'.
  Column 'peer' is the network address of the client (something like
  '[::1]:46558' or '<UNIX SOCKET>'). Columns 'hostname', 'application',
  'client', 'clientpid' and 'remark' can be set by the client.
  Libmapi/mclient, pymonetdb and monetdb-java have been modified to fill
  in sensible default values.

* Fri Sep 30 2022 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.1-20230616
- Deprecate mapi_setfilecallback() in favor of mapi_setfilecallback2() which
  can handle binary downloads. For the time being, the old callback still works.

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- Add optional MAPI header field which can be used to immediately
  set reply size, autocommit, time zone and some other options, see
  mapi.h.  This makes client connection setup faster.  Support has been
  added to mapilib, pymonetdb and the jdbc driver.

* Wed Sep 12 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- Removed function mapi_cache_shuffle.
- Removed function mapi_stream_query.

* Thu Mar  8 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- The three mapi_explain* functions and mapi_trace don't return any
  useful information, so they now return void.

* Tue Aug  1 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- The functions mapi_error_str and mapi_result_error now return const char
  * instead of plain char * to indicate that the returned data belongs
  to the library and should not be changed or freed by the application.
- New function const char *mapi_result_errorcode(MapiHdl) which returns
  the SQLSTATE code if available when an error has occurred.

* Fri Mar 28 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.1-20141024
- Changed mapi_timeout argument from seconds to milliseconds.
