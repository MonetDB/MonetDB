* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Add optional MAPI header field which can be used to immediately
  set reply size, autocommit, time zone and some other options, see
  mapi.h.  This makes client connection setup faster.  Support has been
  added to mapilib, pymonetdb and the jdbc driver.
