- Msqldump now accepts --output and --outputdir options.  When the
  --outputdir option is used, the dump is placed in the file dump.sql in
  the specified directory and all tables are dumped to separate CSV files.
  In this way it is feasible to edit the dump script by hand if needed,
  even for a large database.

- The --table (-t) option of msqldump now accepts SQL-style % wildcard
  characters to dump all tables that match the pattern.  E.g. -t
  %test%.%test% dumps all tables with 'test' in both the schema and
  table name.

- Implemented interrupt handling in mclient.  When using mclient
  interactively, an interrupt (usually control-C) stops whatever the
  client is doing.  When editing a line, the line is discarded; when
  editing a second or later line of a query, the whole query is discarded;
  when a query is being executed, the server is asked to stop the query
  at its earliest convenience.  Stopping a running query can only be
  done with an up-to-date server.  All of this does not work on Windows.
