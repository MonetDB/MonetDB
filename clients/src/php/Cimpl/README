MonetDB extension module for PHP5.

To build this module, you have two options.

1) Compile this module as a standalone module, which will build a shared object (.so)
2) Compile this module within the PHP source tree.


1) Standalone compilation

Use the provided 'Makefile.standalone' file. The PHP development files
have to be installed (php-dev), and the php-config script needs to be
in your path.

    make -f Makefile.standalone
    make -f Makefile.standalone install

2) Compilation within the source tree

This module can be compiled within PHP build structure. you need to
either copy it from within MonetDB directory into PHP source tree or
make a symlink into it, e.g.:

    ln -s $MONETDB_ROOT/src/mapi/clients/php/Cimpl $PHP_SRC/ext/monetdb

Then, regenerate PHP's configure script for the module to show up:

    cd $PHP_SRC
    rm configure; ./buildconf --force

To compile it, you need to have MONETDB_PREFIX declared in your 
environment, and then configure and install php e.g.:
    configure --with-monetdb=shared
	make 
	make install
	
Possibly in the (near) future it will be possible to compile it independently,
within MonetDB compiling/testing facilities.

examples/monetdb_query_demo.php is a demonstration of current features 
available in this module.
