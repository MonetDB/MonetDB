The Python API is already usable, but some things need some more attention:

* Improve exception types and messages
* Improve type conversion (for example string, can't handle substrings well)
* Speed tests / profiling
* Get the capabilities tests working
* Configure the logging module correctly
* Code cleanup (fix all TODO's in the source)
* Add unit tests for unicode and invalid query
* Add unit tests for MAPI
* Add transaction support (set default autocommit off, make set_autocommit)
* Add more cursor types (dict cursor)
* Modify XQuery API to use native MAPI
* Add a central exception handler
