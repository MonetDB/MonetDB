- ODBC now supports TLS. It can be configured through the following
  DSN- or Connection String attributes (canonical name / user friendly name):
    TLS / Encrypt = ON/OFF
    CERT / Server Certificate = PATH
    CERTHASH / Server Certificate Hash = sha256:HEXDIGITS
    CLIENTKEY / Client Key = PATH
    CLIENTCERT / Client Certificate = PATH
- Several more connection properties have been made configurable:
    SCHEMA / Schema = NAME
    TIMEZONE / Time Zone = Minutes East Of UTC
    REPLYSIZE / Reply Size = NUMBER
    LOGFILE / Log File = PATH
    LOGINTIMEOUT / Login Timeout = MILLISECONDS
    CONNECTIONTIMEOUT / Connection Timeout = MILLISECONDS
    AUTOCOMMIT / Autocommit = ON/OFF
    SOCK / Unix Socket = PATH (unix only)
- SQLBrowseConnect() adds On/Off suggestions to boolean settings
  and prioritizes the DATABASE attribute if it notices monetdbd
  requires one. Apart from that only UID/User and PWD/Password
  are required, all others have sensible defaults.
