# ChangeLog file for odbc
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Jun  2 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed implementation of SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_MAX_DRIVER_CONNECTIONS,
  ...). It used to always return a value of 64. Now it returns the
  MonetDB server value.

* Thu May 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected SQLSpecialColumns(..., SQL_BEST_ROWID, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary key. Now it also returns
  rows when a table has a unique constraint.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_INDEX_ALL, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary or unique key. Now it also
  returns rows for indices which are not based on a key.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_ENSURE). It now returns CARDINALITY
  information for columns based on a primary/unique key. Previously it
  always returned NULL for the CARDINALITY result column.

* Thu Apr 21 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected ODBC API functions SQLPrimaryKeys(), SQLSpecialColumns() and
  SQLStatistics() for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did
  not return any rows when the temp table had a primary or unique key or
  index. Now they do return rows as expected.
