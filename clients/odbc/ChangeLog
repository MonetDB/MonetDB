# ChangeLog file for odbc
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Jun  9 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- For SQLForeignKeys() corrected the output of columns UPDATE_RULE and
  DELETE_RULE. These columns used to always return 3 (= SQL_NO_ACTION)
  but now they will report the action codes as specified in the FOREIGN KEY
  CONSTRAINT construction.

* Thu Jun  2 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed issue in function SQLProcedureColumns(). When the argument ColumnName
  was not empty it generated an invalid SQL query which failed with error:
   SELECT: no such column 'c.name'. This has been resolved.
- Corrected implementation of SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_MAX_DRIVER_CONNECTIONS, ...).
  It used to always return 64. Now it returns the value from the MonetDB server.
- Changed the column names case of the result sets as returned by
  SQLTables(), SQLColumns(), SQLSpecialColumns(), SQLPrimaryKeys(),
  SQLForeignKeys(), SQLStatistics(), SQLTablePrivileges(),
  SQLColumnPrivileges(), SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns(). The
  column names where all in lowercase but the ODBC specification defines
  them in uppercase, so changed them to uppercase.

* Thu May 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected SQLSpecialColumns(..., SQL_BEST_ROWID, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary key. Now it also returns
  rows when a table has a unique constraint.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_INDEX_ALL, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary or unique key. Now it also
  returns rows for indices which are not based on a key.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_ENSURE). It now returns CARDINALITY
  information for columns based on a primary/unique key. Previously it
  always returned NULL for the CARDINALITY result column.

* Thu Apr 21 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected ODBC API functions SQLPrimaryKeys(), SQLSpecialColumns() and
  SQLStatistics() for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did
  not return any rows when the temp table had a primary or unique key or
  index. Now they do return rows as expected.
