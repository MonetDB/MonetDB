* Wed Jan  4 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- A crash in the ODBC driver was fixed when certain unsupported functions
  where used in a {fn ...} escape.

* Wed Dec 21 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.45.13-20230124
- Prepare of a query where the sum of the number of parameters (question
  marks in the query) and the number of output columns is larger than
  100 could fail with an unexpected error.  This has been fixed.

* Thu Oct 13 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.9-20221128
- Fixed issue with generated raw strings prefix when ODBC driver is used
  against a server older than Jun2020 (11.37).

* Thu Sep  1 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Improved SQLSetPos(). It now allows RowNumber to be 0 when Operation
  is SQL_POSITION.

* Thu Jul 28 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Improved ODBC Error/Warning messages. They now include the name of the
  Data Source as required by the ODBC specification:
  [MonetDB][ODBC driver VERSION][data-source-name] data-source-supplied-text

* Wed Jul 27 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Improved MonetDB ODBC Data Source Configuration dialog on MS Windows by
  hiding the typed in password text. It now shows dots for the characters.
  This fixes request  https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB/issues/7314

* Thu Jul 21 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Changed output of TABLE_CAT or PROCEDURE_CAT result columns as returned
  by ODBC functions: SQLTables(), SQLColumns(), SQLPrimaryKeys(),
  SQLForeignKeys(), SQLStatistics(), SQLTablePrivileges(),
  SQLColumnPrivileges(), SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns().
  They used to return the static database name but now they will return
  NULL as MonetDB does not support CATALOG objects or qualifiers.

* Thu Jul 14 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Removed the possibility to retrieve or set the CURRENT_CATALOG
  via SQLGetConnectAttr(hdbc, SQL_ATTR_CURRENT_CATALOG, ...) and
  SQLSetConnectAttr(hdbc, SQL_ATTR_CURRENT_CATALOG, ...) as MonetDB does
  not support CATALOG objects (no SQL support for: CREATE CATALOG abc
  or SET CATALOG abc) and therefore there is no CURRENT_CATALOG.

* Thu Jun 23 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Corrected ODBC functions SQLTablePrivileges() and SQLColumnPrivileges()
  for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did not return
  any rows when the temporary table had privileges set. Now they do return
  rows as expected.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Improved SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns(). They now list
  information also for all built-in system procedures and functions, not
  only those created via SQL. Also corrected the value of ORDINAL_POSITION
  for scalar function arguments. It would start at 2 instead of 1.
- Extended output of SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns() resultsets
  with an extra column SPECIFIC_NAME. This column contains the name which
  uniquely identifies this procedure or function within its schema. As
  MonetDB supports overloaded procedures and functions, the combination of
  PROCEDURE_SCHEM and PROCEDURE_NAME is not enough to uniquely identify
  a procedure or function. This extra column allows you to correctly
  match the corresponding rows returned by SQLProcedureColumns() with the
  specific rows of SQLProcedures(). This extra column SPECIFIC_NAME is
  implemented similar to the JDBC DatabaseMetaData methods getProcedures()
  and getProcedureColumns().

* Thu Jun  9 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- For SQLForeignKeys() corrected the output of columns UPDATE_RULE and
  DELETE_RULE. These columns used to always return 3 (= SQL_NO_ACTION)
  but now they will report the action codes as specified in the FOREIGN KEY
  CONSTRAINT construction.

* Thu Jun  2 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Fixed issue in function SQLProcedureColumns(). When the argument ColumnName
  was not empty it generated an invalid SQL query which failed with error:
   SELECT: no such column 'c.name'. This has been resolved.
- Corrected implementation of SQLGetInfo(hdbc, SQL_MAX_DRIVER_CONNECTIONS, ...).
  It used to always return 64. Now it returns the value from the MonetDB server.
- Changed the column names case of the result sets as returned by
  SQLTables(), SQLColumns(), SQLSpecialColumns(), SQLPrimaryKeys(),
  SQLForeignKeys(), SQLStatistics(), SQLTablePrivileges(),
  SQLColumnPrivileges(), SQLProcedures() and SQLProcedureColumns(). The
  column names where all in lowercase but the ODBC specification defines
  them in uppercase, so changed them to uppercase.

* Thu May 19 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Corrected SQLSpecialColumns(..., SQL_BEST_ROWID, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary key. Now it also returns
  rows when a table has a unique constraint.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_INDEX_ALL, ...). Previously it only
  returned rows when the table had a primary or unique key. Now it also
  returns rows for indices which are not based on a key.
- Corrected SQLStatistics(..., SQL_ENSURE). It now returns CARDINALITY
  information for columns based on a primary/unique key. Previously it
  always returned NULL for the CARDINALITY result column.

* Thu Apr 21 2022 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.45.1-20220913
- Corrected ODBC functions SQLPrimaryKeys(), SQLSpecialColumns() and
  SQLStatistics() for local temporary tables located in schema tmp. They did
  not return any rows when the temp table had a primary or unique key or
  index. Now they do return rows as expected.

* Fri May  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- A typo that made the SQLSpecialColumns function unusable was fixed.

* Wed Mar 31 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- When connecting using a DSN (Data Source Name), information about the
  data source is retrieved from the ODBC.INI file.  Now we also get the
  location of the LOGFILE from this file.  The logfile can be used to
  log all calls to the MonetDB ODBC driver to a file which can be used
  for debugging.

* Thu Mar 25 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- The ODBC driver now only passes on information about HUGEINT columns
  as HUGEINT when the application has indicated interest by querying
  about the SQL_HUGEINT extension type using the SQLGetTypeInfo
  function or by specifying the type in a call to SQLSetDescField.
  Otherwise the driver silently translates the HUGEINT type to BIGINT.
  This means that most application will see BIGINT columns when the
  server produced a HUGEINT column and only give an error if the value
  in the HUGEINT column didn't fit into a BIGINT.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- The NUMERIC and FLOAT types are now handled fully.  Before only DECIMAL,
  FLOAT, and DOUBLE were handled fully.
- Some bugs were fixed in the passing back and forth between application
  and server of values of type GUID (UUID).
