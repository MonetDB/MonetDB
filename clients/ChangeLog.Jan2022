# ChangeLog file for clients

- Improved the handling of the \r command in mclient.  It now properly
  counts the header of table, and when a (very) long table is being
  printed and aborted part way in the built-in pager, not all data is
  transferred to the client (and then discarded).  Instead at most 1000
  rows are transferred.
