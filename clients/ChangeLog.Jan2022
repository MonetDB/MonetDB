# ChangeLog file for clients
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Aug 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- A new output formatting mode was added to mclient.  Use -fcsv-noquote
  to produce a CSV (comma-separated values) output where the quote
  characters have not been escapes.  This can be useful when producing
  a single column string output that should be saved as is, e.g. when
  using the sys.dump_database() function.
