# ChangeLog file for devel
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Mon Oct 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The ranges of merge partitions are now pushed down into the low
  level GDK operations, giving them a handle to sometimes execute more
  efficiently.

* Thu Jul 27 2023 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl>
- Removed the PYTHON MAP external language option, as after a fork the
  synchronization primitives could be in any state, leading to deadlocks.
  During the upgrade function definitions will fallback to the normal
  PYTHON language option.

* Mon Jul 17 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Implemented direct masking for strimp construction. The strimps
  datastructure now keeps an array of 65K 64-bit integers that is zero
  everywhere except at the indexes that correspond to header pairs. The
  entry for the nth pair in order has the nth bit of the bitstring
  on. These can be used to quickly construct bitstrings.
