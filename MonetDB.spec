%description
MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
accelerators.  It also has an SQL front end.

This package contains the core components of MonetDB in the form of a
single shared library.  If you want to use MonetDB, you will certainly
need this package, but you will also need at least the MonetDB5-server
package, and most likely also %{name}-SQL-server5, as well as one or
more client packages.

MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
accelerators.  It also has an SQL front end.

This package contains the SELinux policy for running MonetDB under
control of systemd.  There is one tunable parameter, mserver5_can_read_home,
which can be set using "setsebool -P mserver5_can_read_home=true" to allow
an mserver5 process started by monetdbd under the control of systemd to
read files in users' home directories.

%changelog
* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.31-20230324
- Rebuilt.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.31-20230324
- gdk: When processing the WAL, if a to-be-destroyed object cannot be found,
  don't stop, but keep processing the rest of the WAL.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.31-20230324
- monetdb5: Client connections are cleaned up better so that we get fewer instances
  of clients that cannot connect.

* Fri Mar 24 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.31-20230324
- sql: Increased the size of a variable counting the number of changes made
  to the database (e.g. in case more than a 2 billion rows are added to
  a table).
- sql: Improved cleanup after failures such as failed memory allocations.

* Thu Feb 23 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- Rebuilt.

* Mon Feb 20 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: A race condition was fixed where certain write-ahead log messages
  could get intermingled, resulting in a corrupted WAL file.
- gdk: If opening of a file failed when it was supposed to get memory mapped,
  an incorrect value was returned to indicate the failure, causing
  crashes later on.  This has been fixed.

* Mon Feb 13 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: When saving a bat failed for some reason during a low-level commit,
  this was logged in the log file, but the error was then subsequently
  ignored, possibly leading to files that are too short or even missing.
- gdk: The write-ahead log (WAL) is now rotated a bit more efficiently by
  doing multiple log files in one go (i.e. in one low-level transaction).

* Mon Feb 13 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- sql: An insert into a table from which a column was dropped in a parallel
  transaction was incorrectly not flagged as a transaction conflict.

* Mon Jan 16 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: Fixed a race condition that could lead to a bat being added to the SQL
  catalog but nog being made persistent, causing a subsequent restart
  of the system to fail (and crash).

* Fri Dec 16 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- sql: Added some error checking to prevent crashes.  Errors would mainly
  occur under memory pressure.

* Wed Dec 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: Fixed a race condition where a hash could have been created on a
  bat using the old bat count while in another thread the bat count
  got updated.  This would make the hash be based on too small a size,
  causing failures later on.

* Wed Dec 14 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- sql: Fixed cleanup after a failed allocation where the data being cleaned
  up was unitialized but still used as pointers to memory that also had
  to be freed.

* Thu Dec  8 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: When extending a bat failed, the capacity had been updated already and
  was therefore too large.  This could then later cause a crash.  This has
  been fixed by only updating the capacity if the extend succeeded.

* Wed Dec  7 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- gdk: A bug was fixed when dealing with copy-on-write memory maps.  These can
  occur for some bats used by the write-ahead log code when they grow
  large enough.

* Wed Dec  7 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- sql: A bug was fixed when optimizing combining of range select
  subexpressions.
- sql: If there was an error in one of the special commands to the server
  (e.g. setting the reply size for result sets), the server could get
  into an infinite loop.  This has been fixed.
- sql: Fixed a double cleanup after a failed allocation in COPY INTO.  The
  double cleanup could cause a crash due to a race condition it enabled.

* Wed Oct 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- monetdb5: Fix a bug where the MAL optimizer would use the starttime of the
  previous query to determine whether a query timeout occurred.

* Wed Oct 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.29-20230223
- merovingian: Stop logging references to monetdbd's logfile in said logfile.

* Fri Aug 26 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- Rebuilt.

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- merovingian: In certain cases (when an mserver5 process exits right after producing
  a message) the log message was logged over and over again, causing
  monetdbd to use 100% CPU.  This has been fixed.

* Fri Aug 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- sql: Fixed a busy loop in the code that applies the write-ahead log when
  there are log files that cannot yet be cleaned due to active
  transactions.  This loop can become nasty when mserver5 is exiting.

* Wed Aug 10 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- gdk: A bug was fixed when upgrading a database from the Oct2020 releases
  (11.39.X) or older when the write-ahead log (WAL) was not empty and
  contained instructions to create new tables.

* Thu Aug 04 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- gdk: Avoid logging of failure to backup files that didn't need to be backed
  up in the first place.

* Wed Aug 03 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.27-20220826
- gdk: Avoid an attempt to access a file when the database is in memory.

* Tue Aug 02 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- Rebuilt.

* Tue Aug  2 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- gdk: When destroying a bat, make sure there are no files left over in
  the BACKUP directory since they can cause problems when the bat id
  gets reused.

* Thu Jul 28 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- gdk: Fixed an off-by-one error in the logger which caused older log files
  to stick around longer in the write-ahead log than necessary.
- gdk: When an empty BAT is committed, skip writing (and synchronizing to
  disk) the heap (tail and theap) files and write 0 for their sizes to
  the BBP.dir file.  When reading the BBP.dir file, if an empty BAT is
  encountered, set the sizes of those files to 0.  This fixes potential
  issues during startup of the server (BBPcheckbats reporting errors).

* Thu Jun 23 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- merovingian: When multiple identical messages are written to the log, write the
  first one, and combine subsequent ones in a single message.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- gdk: Make sure heap files of transient bats get deleted when the bat is
  destroyed.  If the bat was a partial view (sharing the vheap but not
  the tail), the tail file wasn't deleted.
- gdk: Various changes were made to satisfy newer compilers.
- gdk: The batDirtydesc and batDirtyflushed Boolean values have been deprecated
  and are no longer used.  They were both holdovers from long ago.
- gdk: Various race conditions (data races) have been fixed.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- merovingian: Fixed a leak where the log file wasn't closed when it was reopened
  after a log rotation (SIGHUP signal).
- merovingian: Try to deal more gracefully with "inherited" mserver5 processes.
  This includes not complaining about an "impossible state", and allowing
  such processes to be stopped by the monetdbd process.
- merovingian: When a transient failure occurs during processing of a new connection to
  the monetdbd server, sleep for half a second so that if the transient
  failure occurs again, the log file doesn't get swamped with error
  messages.

* Wed Jun 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- monetdb5: Various race conditions (data races) have been fixed.

* Thu May 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.25-20220802
- gdk: All accesses to the BACKUP directory need to be protected by the
  same lock.  The lock already existed (GDKtmLock), but wasn't used
  consistently.  This is now fixed.  Hopefully this makes the hot snapshot
  code more reliable.

* Mon Apr 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.23-20220425
- Rebuilt.

* Mon Apr 25 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.23-20220425
- sql: GLOBAL TEMPORARY tables are now treated like LOCAL TEMPORARY tables
  as far as the table content is concerned.  The schema information
  stays global.  This fixes an issue with concurrent access and cleanup
  of stale data.

* Tue Mar 22 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.21-20220322
- Rebuilt.

* Fri Mar 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.21-20220322
- gdk: Fixed a race condition which could cause a too large size being written
  for a .theap file to the BBP.dir file after the correct size file had
  been saved to disk.
- gdk: We now ignore the size and capacity columns in the BBP.dir file.
  These values are essential during run time, but not useful in the
  on-disk image of the database.

* Fri Mar 18 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.21-20220322
- merovingian: Disabled logging into merovingian.log of next info message types:
  "proxying client <host>:<port> for database '<dbname>' to <url>" and
  "target connection is on local UNIX domain socket, passing on filedescriptor instead of proxying".
  These messages were written to the log file at each connection. In most
  cases this information is not used. The disabling reduces the log file size.

* Fri Mar 11 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.19-20220311
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7267: Update after delete does not update some rows

* Wed Mar 09 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.17-20220309
- Rebuilt.

* Wed Mar  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.17-20220309
- gdk: Found and fixed another source for the now infamous BBPcheckbats error
  that sometimes occurs at startup of the server.

* Thu Feb 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.15-20220224
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7225: Invalid memory access when extending a BAT during appends
- GH#7228: COMMIT: transaction is aborted because of concurrency conflicts,
  will ROLLBACK instead
- sql: Add number of rows affected by output statements into the total
  rowcount
- gdk: Fixed race condition during backup of BATs.
- gdk: Fixed append to BATs of type msk (bit mask).
- sql: Fix to MAL code generation.
- gdk: Fix to WAL logger when a BAT gets replaced within a transaction.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7163: Multiple sql.mvc() invocations in the same query
- GH#7167: sys.shutdown() problems
- GH#7184: Insert into query blocks all other queries
- GH#7185: GROUPING SETS on groups with aliases provided in the SELECT
  returns empty result
- GH#7186: data files created with COPY SELECT .. INTO 'file.csv' fail to
  be loaded using COPY INTO .. FROM 'file.csv' when double quoted string
  data contains the field values delimiter character
- GH#7191: [MonetDBe] monetdbe_cleanup_statement() with bound NULLs on
  variable-sized types bug
- GH#7196: BATproject2: does not match always
- GH#7198: Suboptimal query plan for query containing JSON access filter
  and two negative string comparisons
- GH#7200: PRIMARY KEY unique constraint is violated with concurrent
  inserts
- GH#7206: Python UDF fails when returning an empty table as a dictionary

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- clients: Dumping the database now also dumps the read-only and insert-only
  states of tables.

* Mon Dec 13 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- gdk: Sometimes when the server was restarted, it wouldn't start anymore due
  to an error from BBPcheckbats.  We finally found and fixed a (hopefully
  "the") cause of this problem.

* Thu Oct 28 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.13-20211213
- sql: Number parsing for SQL was fixed.  If a number was immediately followed
  by letters (i.e. without a space), the number was accepted and the
  alphanumeric string starting with the letter was interpreted as an alias
  (if aliases were allowed in that position).

* Thu Sep 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.11-20210930
- Rebuilt.

* Tue Sep 28 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.9-20210928
- Rebuilt.

* Mon Sep 27 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7140: SQL Query Plan Non Optimal with View
- GH#7162: Extend sys.var_values table
- GH#7165: `JOINIDX: missing '.'` when running distributed join query on
  merged remote tables
- GH#7172: Unexpected query result with merge tables

  between the generated plan and the expected one: 1 != 1200

* Wed Sep 22 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- gdk: Some deadlock and race condition issues were fixed.
- gdk: Handling of the list of free bats has been improved, leading to less
  thread contention.
- gdk: A problem was fixed where the server wouldn't start with a message from
  BBPcheckbats about files being too small.  The issue was not that the
  file was too small, but that BBPcheckbats was looking at the wrong file.
- gdk: An issue was fixed where a "short read" error was produced when memory
  was getting tight.

* Wed Sep 22 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: If the server has been idle for a while with no active clients, the
  write-ahead log is now rotated.
- sql: A problem was fixed where files belonging to bats that had been deleted
  internally were not cleaned up, leading to a growing database (dbfarm)
  directory.
- sql: A leak was fixed where extra bats were created but never cleaned up,
  each taking up several kilobytes of memory.

* Tue Aug 17 2021 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: [This feature was already released in Jul2021 (11.41.5), but the ChangeLog was missing]
  Grant indirect privileges.  With "GRANT SELECT ON <my_view> TO
  <another_user>"  and "GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION <my_func> TO
  <another_user>", one can grant access to "my_view" and "my_func"
  to another user who does not have access to the underlying database
  objects (e.g. tables, views) used in "my_view" and "my_func".  The
  grantee will only be able to access data revealed by "my_view" or
  conduct operations provided by "my_func".

* Mon Aug 16 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- sql: Improved error reporting in COPY INTO by giving the line number
  (starting with one) for the row in which an error was found.  In
  particular, the sys.rejects() table now lists the line number of the
  CSV file on which the record started in which an error was found.

* Wed Aug 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.7-20210927
- gdk: When appending to a string bat, we made an optimization where the string
  heap was sometimes copied completely to avoid having to insert strings
  individually.  This copying was still done too eagerly, so now the
  string heap is copied less frequently.  In particular, when appending
  to an empty bat, the string heap is now not always copied whole.

* Tue Aug 03 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.5-20210803
- Rebuilt.
- GH#7161: fix priority

* Tue Aug  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.5-20210803
- gdk: A bug in the grouping code has been fixed.

* Tue Aug  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.5-20210803
- sql: The system view sys.ids has been updated to include some more system
  IDs.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- Rebuilt.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- gdk: Hash indexes are no longer maintained at all cost: if the number of
  distinct values is too small compared to the total number of values,
  the index is dropped instead of being maintained during updates.

* Fri Jul 30 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- sql: The sys.storage() function now only returns meta data, i.e. data that
  can be calculated without access to the column contents.

* Wed Jul 28 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.3-20210730
- sql: Since STREAM tables support is removed, left over STREAM tables are
  dropped from the catalog.

* Fri Jul 23 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- mapilib: Add optional MAPI header field which can be used to immediately
  set reply size, autocommit, time zone and some other options, see
  mapi.h.  This makes client connection setup faster.  Support has been
  added to mapilib, pymonetdb and the jdbc driver.

* Wed Jul 21 2021 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Fix a warning emitted by some implementations of the tar(1) command
  when unpacking hot snapshot files.
- sql: support reading the concatenation of compressed files as a single
  compressed file.
- sql: COPY BINARY overhaul.  Allow control over binary endianness using
  COPY [ (BIG | LITTLE | NATIVE) ENDIAN] BINARY syntax.  Defaults to
  NATIVE.  Strings are now \0 terminated rather than \n.  Support for
  BOOL, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, LARGEINT, HUGEINT, with their
  respective "INTMIN" values as the NULL representation; 32 and 64 bit
  FLOAT/REAL, with NaN as the NULL representation; VARCHAR/TEXT, JSON
  and URL with \x80 as the NULL representation; UUID as fixed width 16
  byte binary values, with (by default) all zeroes as the NULL
  representation; temporal type structs as defined in copybinary.h
  with any invalid value as the NULL representation.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: In the Jul2021 release the storage and transaction layers have
  undergone major changes.  The goal of these changes is robust
  performance under inserts/updates and deletes and lowering the
  transaction startup costs, allowing faster (small) queries.  Where
  the old transaction layer duplicated a lot of data structures during
  startup, the new layer shares the same tree.  Using object
  timestamps the isolation of object is guaranteed.  On the storage
  side the timestamps indicate whether a row is visible (deleted or
  valid), to a transaction as well.  The changes also give some slight
  changes on the perceived transactional behavior.  The new
  implementation uses shared structures among all transactions, which
  do not allow multiple changes of the same object.  And we then
  follow the principle of the first writer wins, i.e., if a
  transaction creates a table with name 'table_name', and concurrently
  one other transaction does the same the later of the two will fail
  with a concurrency conflict error message (even if the first writer
  never commits).  We expect most users not to notice this change, as
  such schema changes aren't usually done concurrently.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- clients: The MonetDB stethoscope has been removed.  There is now a separate
  package available with PIP (monetdb_stethoscope) or as an RPM or DEB
  package (stethoscope) from the monetdb.org repository.

* Tue Jul 20 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: A new type, called msk, was introduced.  This is a bit mask type.
  In a bat with type msk, each row occupies a single bit, so 8 rows are
  stored in a single byte.  There is no NULL value for this type.
- gdk: The function of the BAT iterator (type BATiter, function bat_iterator)
  has been expanded.  The iterator now contains more information about
  the BAT, and it contains a pointer to the heaps (theap and tvheap)
  that are stable, at least in the sense that they will remain available
  even when parallel threads update the BAT and cause those heaps to grow
  (and therefore possibly move in memory).  A call to bat_iterator must
  now be accompanied by a call to bat_iterator_end.

* Mon Jun  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: When using the --in-memory option, mserver5 will run completely in
  memory, i.e. not create a database on disk.  The server can still be
  connected to using the name of the in-memory database.  This name is
  "in-memory".

* Tue May 11 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: There is now a function sys.current_sessionid() to return the session
  ID of the current session.  This ID corresponds with the sessionid in
  the sys.queue() result.

* Mon May 10 2021 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: Deprecate `profilerstart` and `profilerstop` commands. Since
  stethoscope is a separate project (https://github.com/MonetDBSolutions/monetdb-pystethoscope)
  the installation directory is not standard anymore. `profilerstart` and
  `profilerstop` commands assume that the stethoscope executable is in the
  same directory as `mserver5`. This is no longer necessarily true since
  stethoscope can now be installed in a python virtual environment. The
  commands still work if stethoscope is installed using the official
  MonetDB installers, or if a symbolic link is created in the directory
  where `mserver5` is located.

* Fri May  7 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- odbc: A typo that made the SQLSpecialColumns function unusable was fixed.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Merge statements could not produce correct results on complex join
  conditions, so a renovation was made. As a consequence, subqueries
  now have to be disabled on merge join conditions.

* Mon May  3 2021 svetlin <svetlin.stalinov@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: preserve in-query comments

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- merovingian: The exittimeout value can now be set to a negative value (e.g. -1) to
  indicate that when stopping the dbfarm (using monetdbd stop dbfarm),
  any mserver5 processes are to be sent a termination signal and then
  waited for until they terminate.  In addition, if exittimeout is greater
  than zero, the mserver5 processes are sent a SIGKILL signal after the
  specified timeout and the managing monetdbd is sent a SIGKILL signal
  after another five seconds (if it didn't terminate already).  The old
  situation was that the managing monetdbd process was sent a SIGKILL
  after 30 seconds, and the mserver5 processes that hadn't terminated
  yet would be allowed to continue their termination sequence.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented function BUNreplacemultiincr to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, starting at a given position.
- gdk: Implemented new function BUNreplacemulti to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, at the given positions.
- gdk: Removed function BUNinplace, just use BUNreplace, and check whether
  the BAT argument is of type TYPE_void before calling if you don't
  want to materialize.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Use of CTEs inside UPDATE and DELETE statements are now more
  restrict. Previously they could be used without any extra specification
  in the query (eg. with "v1"("c1") as (...) delete from "t"
  where "t"."c1" = "v1"."c1"), however this was not conformant with the
  SQL standard. In order to use them, they must be specified in the FROM
  clause in UPDATE statements or inside a subquery.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Implemented a function BUNappendmulti which appends an array of values
  to a BAT.  It is a generalization of the function BUNappend.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Changed the interface of the atom read function.  It now requires an
  extra pointer to a size_t value that gives the current size of the
  destination buffer, and when that buffer is too small, it receives the
  size of the reallocated buffer that is large enough.  In any case,
  and as before, the return value is a pointer to the destination buffer.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: Environment variables (sys.env()) must be UTF-8, but since they can
  contain file names which may not be UTF-8, there is now a mechanism
  to store the original values outside of sys.env() and store
  %-escaped (similar to URL escaping) values in the environment.  The
  key must still be UTF-8.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- gdk: We now save the location of the min and max values when known.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Added 'schema path' property to user, specifying a list of schemas
  to be searched on to find SQL objects such as tables and
  functions. The scoping rules have been updated to support this feature
  and it now finds SQL objects in the following order:
   1. On occasions with multiple tables (e.g. add foreign key constraint,
      add table to a merge table), the child will be searched on the
      parent's schema.
   2. For tables only, declared tables on the stack.
   3. 'tmp' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
   4. Session's current schema.
   5. Each schema from the 'schema path' in order.
   6. 'sys' schema if not listed on the 'schema path'.
  Whenever the full path is specified, ie "schema"."object", no search will
  be made besides on the explicit schema.
- sql: To update the schema path ALTER USER x SCHEMA PATH y; statement was added.
  [SCHEMA PATH string] syntax was added to the CREATE USER statement.
  The schema path must be a single string where each schema must be between
  double quotes and separated with a single comma, e.g. '"sch1","sch2"'
  For every created user, if the schema path is not given, '"sys"' will be
  the default schema path.
- sql: Changes in the schema path won't be reflected on currently connected users,
  therefore they have to re-connect to see the change. Non existent schemas
  on the path will be ignored.

* Mon May  3 2021 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.41.1-20210723
- sql: Leftover STREAM table definition from Datacell extension was removed
  from the parser. They had no effect anymore.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.41.1-20210723
- monetdb5: By using the option "--dbextra=in-memory", mserver5 can be instructed
  to keep transient BATs completely in memory.

* Mon May 03 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- gdk: A bug that would very occasionally produce an error "strPut: incorrectly
  encoded UTF-8", even when no incorrectly coded characters are used
  at all, has been fixed.  It was the result of a rare combination of
  strings having been added to the column that caused essentially an
  off-by-one type of error to occur.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- merovingian: When stopping monetdbd using the `monetdbd stop' command, this command
  now waits for 5 seconds longer than the exittimeout value before it
  kills the monetdbd daemon instead of only 30 seconds total (or until
  that daemon stops earlier).  This gives the daemon enough time to
  terminate the mserver5 processes that it is managing.  If exittimeout
  is negative, the daemon and the monetdbd process initiating the stop
  wait indefinitely until the mserver5 processes have stopped.

* Mon May  3 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- sql: A bug where a sequence of TRUNCATE TABLE and COPY INTO the just
  truncated table would result in success being reported to both queries,
  but the table still being empty afterwards, has been fixed.

* Fri Apr 23 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.17-20210503
- NT: Added the monetdbe library to the Windows installer.

* Wed Mar 31 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- odbc: When connecting using a DSN (Data Source Name), information about the
  data source is retrieved from the ODBC.INI file.  Now we also get the
  location of the LOGFILE from this file.  The logfile can be used to
  log all calls to the MonetDB ODBC driver to a file which can be used
  for debugging.

* Thu Mar 25 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.15-20210402
- odbc: The ODBC driver now only passes on information about HUGEINT columns
  as HUGEINT when the application has indicated interest by querying
  about the SQL_HUGEINT extension type using the SQLGetTypeInfo
  function or by specifying the type in a call to SQLSetDescField.
  Otherwise the driver silently translates the HUGEINT type to BIGINT.
  This means that most application will see BIGINT columns when the
  server produced a HUGEINT column and only give an error if the value
  in the HUGEINT column didn't fit into a BIGINT.

* Thu Aug 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.1-20201006
- monetdb5: The settings for specifying how mserver5 should listen to "The
  Internet" have been overhauled.  See the manual for details.  In
  brief, mapi_autosense, mapi_ipv6 and mapi_open are gone.  If
  mapi_listenaddr equals "localhost" or "all", we listen to both IPv4
  and IPv6 (if available), if "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0", we listen to
  IPv4 only, if "::1" or "::" we listen to IPv6 only.  The first of
  each pair is loopback interface only, the second is all interfaces.
  If mapi_listenaddr is "none", then no IP port is opened, you need to
  use a UNIX domain socket.  If mapi_port is 0, we let the operating
  system choose a free port (like mapi_autosense).  Default behavior
  has not changed.

* Mon Aug 10 2020 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- MonetDB: Finished a first version of the new monitoring function
  user_statistics(), which is only intended for the DBAs.
  For each database user who has logged in during the current mserver5
  session, it returns
  "username": login name of the database user,
  "querycount": the number of queries this user has executed since his/her
      first login,
  "totalticks": the total execution time (in microsecond) of the queries ran
      by this user,
  "maxquery": the query with the longest execution time (if two queries have
      the same execution time, the newer overwrites the older),
  "maxticks": the execution time of the 'maxquery' (in microsecond),
  "started": the start timestamp of the 'maxquery',
  "finished": the finish timestamp of the 'maxquery'.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Removed compatibility between interval types and other numeric types in
  favor for a more strict SQL standard compliance. This means operations
  between temporal types and other numeric types such as INT and
  DECIMAL are no longer possible, instead use interval types.
  e.g. SELECT date '2020-01-01' + 1; now gives the error. Instead do:
  SELECT date '2020-01-01' + interval '1' day; if 1 was meant to be a
  day interval.
  Setting an interval variable such as the session's current timezone
  with a number e.g. SET current_timezone = 1; is no longer possible.
  Instead do SET current_timezone = interval '1' hour;
  Casting between interval and other numeric types is no longer possible
  as well, because they are not compatible.
- sql: Because of incompatibilities this change may create, if a user intends
  to convert a numeric value to an interval, the multiplication function
  can be used in the form: <numeric value> * interval '1' <interval length>
  e.g. 10 * interval '1' second = interval '10' second.
  As for the other way around, the 'EPOCH' option was added to the extract
  syntax. This option returns the number of milliseconds since the UNIX
  epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for date, timestamp and time values (it
  can be negative). Meanwhile, for day and second intervals, it returns the
  total number of milliseconds in the interval. As a side note, the 'EPOCH'
  option is not available for month intervals, because this conversion is

- sql: Removed '@' syntax used to refer into a variable in a query. It
  was a non-standard method, which was replaced by a schema addition to
  variables. Variables in the global scope now have schema. All default
  global variables are set under schema "sys". However variables
  inside PSM don't have a schema, because there are no transaction
  semantics inside PSM at the moment.
- sql: Removed declared variables and tables from the global scope. They were
  transaction agnostic and incompatible with the SQL standard, i.e. they
  are valid exclusively under PSM (e.g. functions, procedures and
  triggers).
- sql: Scoping semantics were added for both variables and tables. Variables
  with the same name at a query are now resolved under the following
  precedence rules:
    1. Tables, Views and CTEs at the FROM clause.
    2. Variable declared in the body of function/procedure, i.e. local
       variable.
    3. Function/procedure parameter.
    4. Variable from the global scope.
  Tables with the same name now have the following precedence rules at a
  SQL query:
    1. Table declared in the body of function/procedure, ie local table.
    2. Temporary table.
    3. Table from the current session schema.
  This means the query: SELECT * FROM "keys"; will list keys from
  temporary tables instead of persisted ones, because "keys" table
  is available for both "sys" and "tmp" schemas.
- sql: The table returning function "var" was extended with more details
  about globally declared variables, namely their schema, type and
  current value.

- MonetDB: The sys.queue() has been turned into a circular buffer to allow for
  inspection of both active, paused and recently executed queries.

* Thu Jul 23 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- sql: Extended the system monitor with a table-returning function
  user_statistics() which keeps some statistics for each SQL user, e.g. the
  user's query count, total time spent, and maximal query seen.
