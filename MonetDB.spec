%description
MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
accelerators.  It also has an SQL front end.

This package contains the core components of MonetDB in the form of a
single shared library.  If you want to use MonetDB, you will certainly
need this package, but you will also need at least the MonetDB5-server
package, and most likely also %{name}-SQL-server5, as well as one or
more client packages.

MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
accelerators.  It also has an SQL front end.

This package contains the Python programs and files needed for testing
the MonetDB packages.  You probably don't need this, unless you are a
developer, but if you do want to test, this is the package you need.

%description selinux
MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
accelerators.  It also has an SQL front end.

This package contains the SELinux policy for running MonetDB under
control of systemd.  There is one tunable parameter, mserver5_can_read_home,
which can be set using "setsebool -P mserver5_can_read_home=true" to allow
an mserver5 process started by monetdbd under the control of systemd to
read files in users' home directories.

* Mon Nov  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: Removed functions json.text(string) returns string and json.text(int)
  returns string. Their MAL implementation didn't exist, so they were
  meaningless.

* Thu Oct 17 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- merovingian: Added "vmmaxsize" and "memmaxsize" mserver5 options to the daemon in
  order to set mserver5's maximum virtual and committed memory
  respectively.

* Wed Sep 25 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: Strings are now limited to 1GB, double-quoted tokens are limited to 2kB.
  These sizes are bytes of (UTF-8 encoded) input data.

* Mon Sep 23 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: There are new aggregate functions sys.median_avg and sys.quantile_avg
  that return the interpolated value if the median/quantile doesn't fall
  exactly on a particular row.  These functions always return a value
  of type DOUBLE and only work for numeric types (various width integers
  and floating point).

* Sun Sep  8 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- gdk: BATcalcbetween and all its variants now have an extra bool parameter
  "anti" to invert the test.

* Thu Sep  5 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- monetdb5: The server "console" has been removed, as has the --daemon option.
  The server now doesn't read from standard input anymore.  The way to
  stop a server is by sending it a TERM signal (on Linux/Unix) or by
  sending it an interrupt signal (usually control-C -- on all
  systems).

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: Added sys.deltas ("schema" string, "table" string, "column" string)
  returns table ("values" bigint) system function which returns a single
  column with 6 values: a flag indicating if the column's upper table is
  cleared or not, the count of the RDONLY, RD_INS and RD_UPD_ID deltas
  of the column itself, the number of deleted values of the column's
  table, as well as the level of the current transaction in the
  transaction level tree. It should be used for debugging purposes only.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- monetdb5: Implemented a function bat.diffcand to calculate difference of two
  candidate lists.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- monetdb5: The mtime module was completely rewritten, the atom types date,
  daytime, and timestamp were changed.  Upgrade code for BATs
  containing these types has been implemented.  The old daytime type
  used a 32 bit integer to record milliseconds since the start of the
  day.  The new daytime type uses a 64 bit integer to record
  microseconds since the start of the day.  The old date type recorded
  days since or before the year 1.  The new daytime type records the
  day of the month and the number of months since the year -4712
  separately in a single 32 bit integer of which only 26 bits are
  used.  Dates now use the proleptic Gregorian calendar, meaning the
  normal Gregorian callendar has been extended backward, and before
  the year 1, we have the year 0.  Both the old and new timestamp
  types are a combination of a daytime and a date value, but since
  those types have changed, the timestamp type has also changed.  The
  new date type has a smaller range than the old.  The new date range
  is from the year -4712 to the year 170049.  During conversion of
  date and timestamp columns, the dates are clamped to this range.
- monetdb5: The tzone and rule atom types have been removed.  They were not used
  by any code, and they were defined in a non-portable way.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: Added "VALUES row_list" statement as a top SQL projection statement.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- merovingian: Added ipv6 property to monetdbd properties to force IPv6 addresses
  binding only.  By default this property is false to allow IPv4
  addresses as well.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- monetdb5: Added "mapi_ipv6" property to monet_options to force ipv6 address
  binding only.  This property is inherited while forking from
  monetdbd if it is also set there.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- gdk: All forms of BATcalcbetween and VARcalcbetween have extra bool arguments
  for low inclusive, high inclusive and nils false.  The latter causes
  the result to be false instead of nil if the value being checked is nil.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.35.1-20191118
- monetdb5: Removed (bat)calc.between_symmetric and changed (bat)calc.between
  by adding a number of extra arguments, all of type :bit: symmetric,
  low inclusive, high inclusive, nils false.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Aris Koning <aris.koning@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.35.1-20191118
- sql: The implementation of in-expression now follows a join-based approach
  instead of using iterative union/selects. This greatly improves
  performance for large in-value-lists. Furthermore the old approach has
  large in-value-lists generate large MAL plans. This is now no longer
  the case.

* Fri Aug 30 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.11-20190830
- Rebuilt.
- BZ#6749: mserver5 restart aborts/segfaults after dropping column

- BZ#6748: MonetDB "forgets" columns after ALTER TABLE statements
- BZ#6751: ODBC driver(11.33.3) Seg Faults when "fn ucase" is used in SQL

* Tue Aug 20 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.9-20190820
- sql: Many fixes for using the server in a highly concurrent setting with
  many clients doing read-only queries mixed with clients doing updating
  queries.

* Wed Aug 07 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.7-20190807
- Rebuilt.

* Thu Aug 01 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.5-20190801

* Mon Jul 15 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.5-20190801
- gdk: We now look at the limits imposed by cgroups and the setrlimit system
  call to initialize some internal values related to how much (virtual)
  memory we think is available.

* Fri Jul 12 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.5-20190801
- buildtools: Removed restriction on using combinations of --enable-assert,
  --enable-debug,  and --enable-optimize.  --enable-debug adds a -g (or
  -even -g3) option, --enable-debug=gdb adds a -ggdb3 flag (for GCC);
  --enable-optimize adds a bunch of optimization flags; --disable-debug
  (or --enable-debug=no) removes any -g flags; --disable-optimize
  removes any -O flags; --enable-optimize=auto leaves the optimization
  flags untouched.

* Fri Jun  7 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.5-20190801
- sql: Changed the internal representation of RANGE MINVALUE and RANGE MAXVALUE
  in MERGE TABLE partitions.  Before, the limits were represented by
  the smallest and largest value of the domain of the column, now these
  are represented by a NULL value.  This has the added benefit that if
  you use TO RANGE MAXVALUE, the largest value of the domain is included
  in the partition (before it wasn't).  Also, these new limits now work
  for any ordered type, so including VARCHAR.

* Fri Apr 26 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.3-20190426

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- merovingian: Added a new database property named `profilerbeatfreq`. Its value,
  <freq>, should be an integer and, if it is set the command
  `profilerstart` will call stethoscope with this value as the
  argument to -b. This will instruct stethoscope to collect heartbeat
  events from the MonetDB server every <freq> milliseconds. Please note
  that no type checking is done, and if
  <freq> is not an integer, stethoscope will silently ignore it.

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- buildtools: We now use the C11 atomic operations if available, although
  libatomic_ops is still used if present and not disabled on the configure
  command line.

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: During processing, we now try to maintain the smallest and largest
  values that occur in a BAT.  This information is not saved across
  server restarts.

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- selinux: There is one tunable parameter, mserver5_can_read_home, which can
  be set using "setsebool -P mserver5_can_read_home=true" to allow an
  mserver5 process started by monetdbd under the control of systemd to
  read files in users' home directories.

* Fri Feb  8 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- monetdb5: Changed the way blobs are ordered.  Before, shorter blobs came before
  longer, now the contents is compared first.

* Mon Jan 28 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented two-argument least/greatest functions.  If one argument
  is NULL, the functions return the other value, otherwise they return
  the least/greatest of the two arguments.

* Thu Jan 24 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented SQL2003 natural logarithm function: ln(num_expr).

* Wed Jan 23 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- monetdb5: Removed function blob.tostring() since it cannot guarantee that the
  resulting string is properly encoded in UTF-8.

* Wed Jan 23 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Function octet_length now also accepts a BLOB argument and returns
  the length of the BLOB (i.e. the same as length when called with a
  BLOB argument).

* Tue Jan 22 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- monetdb5: Removed the type "sqlblob", changed the external format of the type
  "blob" to be like what "sqlblob" used to be.  In other words, the
  "blob" type is now SQL-compatible.

* Tue Jan 22 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented length(blob) and comparison between blobs.
- sql: Implemented a two argument function log which calculates the logarithm
  of the first argument using the second argument as base.
- sql: Next to the functions log (natural logarithm) and log10 (base 10
  logarithm), there is now also log2 (base 2 logarithm).

* Fri Jan 18 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Removed unused global SQL variable "history".

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Allow usage of custom expressions in GROUP BY and PARTITION BY
  clauses. The same expressions can be used in the projection phase as
  long as it is exactly the same used in the grouping clause (textual
  lookup is performed). As an example the query:
  SELECT col1*2 FROM t1 GROUP BY col1*2; is correct, while
  SELECT sin(col1+5) FROM t1 GROUP BY col1*2; is wrong.
- sql: Allow usage of WITH clauses in insert, update, delete and merge
  statements.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented merge statements from SQL:2003 standard. Using a source
  relation R, a target table T is updating depending on the result of
  the merge. In case of a match, the table T's row is either updated
  or deleted with R's row. In a non-match case, R's row is inserted
  into T. The grammar is the follows:
  > MERGE INTO target [ [AS] ident ] USING source ON search_condition
  { WHEN MATCHED [ AND search_condition ] THEN
    { UPDATE SET assignment_list | DELETE } } |
  { WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND search_condition ] THEN
    INSERT [ column_list ] [ { DEFAULT VALUES | VALUES row_values } ] }
- sql: Added possibility to change the schema of a table with the syntax:
  > ALTER TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] qname SET SCHEMA ident
- sql: Added optional alias option for target table in update and delete
  statements: (e.g. UPDATE target AS alias SET col1=1 WHERE alias.col2 < 5)

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Improved and extended storagemodel functionality. Changes include:
- sql: Added views sys."tablestorage" and sys."schemastorage" for easy and
  quick assesment of aggregated storage usage per table or per schema.
- sql: Excluded listing system tables in views sys."storage", sys."tablestorage"
  and sys."schemastorage". You can still use sys."storage"() to query
  storage of system tables and columns.
- sql: In procedure sys.storagemodelinit() when populating table
  sys.storagemodelinput it now excludes system tables as system tables are
  not useful to be modeled for storagesize by application users.
  It now also computes and populates the atomwidth column more correctly
  for variable size data types (strings, blobs) when the table has
  representative data in those columns.
- sql: System function sys.columnsize() has been corrected for types: tinyint,
  real, date, time, timetz, sec_interval, month_interval, decimal, uuid,
  mbr, char, clob, json, url, blob, geometry and geometrya.
  For variable size data types (varchar, char, clob, json, url, blob,
  geometry, geometrya) it now returns the columnsize excluding the
  variable heapsize. The heapsize is retrievable via sys.heapsize().
- sql: System function sys.heapsize() has been corrected for all variable size
  data types: varchar, char, clob, json, url, blob, geometry and geometrya.
- sql: System function sys.imprintsize() has been corrected. The imprintsize
  depends on the width (1 or 2 or 4 or 8 or 16 bytes) of the data type.
  Also instead of 12% it now uses 20%, which is a better estimate.
- sql: System function sys.storagemodel() has been removed as it outputs the
  same data as view sys.storagemodel. Use view sys.storagemodel instead.
- sql: Corrected views sys.storagemodel and sys.tablestoragemodel by returning
  a computed orderidxsize when the count has been changed in the
  sys.storagemodelinput table.  Also the views now return data ordered
  by schema, table and column names.
- sql: Extended view sys.tablestoragemodel with column: "storages". Besides
  columns also keys (primary, foreign and unique keys) and indexes
  (ordered, imprints) use storage, so the "storages" count can be higher
  than the number of columns per table.
- sql: Corrected the data type of columns "schema", "table", "column", "type",
  "mode" and location in table sys.storagemodelinput and functions
  sys."storage"(), sys."storage"(sname), sys."storage"(sname, tname)
  and sys."storage"(sname, tname, cname) from string into varchar(1024).
  Consequently also the views based on the table or functions will be
  reporting varchar(1024) as column meta data instead of clob for those
  columns.  This allows faster querying and reporting by generic SQL
  programs which treat clob querying different from varchar columns.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Extended windowing functions catalog with SQL standard semantics.
  Standard aggregation functions can now be used in windowing
  functions: (avg,max,min,sum,prod,count). Other windowing specific
  functions were also implemented: (percent_rank,cume_dist,ntile,
  lag,lead,first_value,last_value,nth_value).
- sql: The standard frame specification was implemented for aggregation
  functions as well as first_value, last_value and nth_value
  functions. The available frames are rows, range and groups.
  Bounds can be unbounded (partition limit), the current row, a fixed
  number of rows (constant), or variable (column as input).
  (e.g SELECT COUNT(col1) OVER (PARTITION BY col2 ORDER BY col3 RANGE
  BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) FROM t1;).
- sql: Added WINDOW keyword which is optionally provided after the FROM
  clause, with window specifications used in the projection
  (e.g SELECT SUM(col1) OVER w1, LAST_VALUE(col2) OVER w2 FROM t1
  WINDOW w1 AS (ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 0 FOLLOWING),
  w2 AS (w1);).
- sql: Our previous partitioning implementation didn’t impose order in the
  input. With this reexamination, partitioning now imposes ascending
  order by default, thus pairing with the industry standard
  implementation.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented X'...' style binary string literals.
- sql: Implemented U&'...' Unicode character string literals and
  U&"..." Unicode delimited identifiers, including UESCAPE.  For the
  string literals, you can have U&'...' '...' '...' UESCAPE '...' where
  the escape must be as single character and the other '...' strings
  are also Unicode character string literals.  For now, these latter
  strings also undergo C-style backslash interpretation.
- sql: Implemented PostgreSQL-like E'...' strings.  The strings can contain
  C-style backslash escapes.  The old format strings '...' currently
  still also accept C-style escapes, but that feature will be removed
  in a future release.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: Added an extra argument of type `bool' to the atom to string and
  string to atom methods to indicate whether the string is for
  internal use (casting the value to or from a string) of external use
  (to be printed).

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- monetdb5: The MAL functions algebra.sort and algebra.firstn now have a new,
  extra second-to-last argument, nilslast:bit, which indicates where
  NIL values are to be sorted: at the beginning, or at the end.  The old
  behavior is when for algebra.sort, the value of nilslast is equal to
  the value or the reverse:bit parameter, for algebra.firstn when the
  value of nilslast is opposite to the value of the asc:bit parameter.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented the NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST option to ORDER BY.  The
  default is NULLS FIRST for ASC(ending) and NULLS LAST for DESC(ending).

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: Implemented a nilslast option for BATfirstn.  If set, NILs come
  last in the ordering that BATfirstn simulates, so non-NIL values are
  preferentially returned.  The old behavior can be obtained by setting
  nilslast to !asc(ending).

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: Implemented a nilslast option for BATsort.  This option should be
  equal to the reverse option for stable sort (it is not implemented for
  stable sort), but can be different from reverse for non-stable sort.
  The functions BATsort and GDKqsort have extra parameters, the function
  GDKqsort_rev has been removed (superseded by GDKqsort with the new
  `reverse' parameter).

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: The BUNtail, BUNtvar, BUNtloc, and BUNtpos macros (and Tloc and Tpos)
  now return a `void *' instead of a `char *'.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Added possibility to rename SQL schemas, tables and columns with ALTER
  statements:
  > ALTER SCHEMA [ IF EXISTS ] ident RENAME TO ident
  > ALTER TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] qname RENAME TO ident
  > ALTER TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] qname RENAME [ COLUMN ] ident TO ident
  Also added optional IF EXISTS clause to other existing ALTER TABLE
  statements.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- clients: The mclient program can now be quit by typing quit or exit on the
  command-line.  This makes it easier for novice users to quit the program
  if they do not know that the standard command to quit is \q.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Aris Koning <aris.koning@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: The sql SAMPLE syntax is extended to include an optional integral SEED
  parameter that sets the seed for the internal random number generator
  in the sample algorithm.  When the seed is set, the user can obtain
  a reproducible sample set from a static dataset with the same sample
  query. The new syntax is
  SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... SAMPLE <expr> [SEED <integer>]

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Implemented a version of COPY INTO that reads/writes files from/to
  the client instead of doing it in the server.  This has the
  advantage that COPY INTO is then no longer restricted to only the
  "super user" monetdb, nor only to absolute file names.  The syntax
  to have the server communicate with the client for file content is
  COPY INTO table FROM file ON CLIENT ...; and COPY query INTO file ON
  CLIENT ...;.  This also works for COPY BINARY INTO.  There is also
  the possibility to specify that files are to be read/written by the
  server by using ON SERVER.  This is also the default when ON CLIENT
  or ON SERVER is not specified.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- stream: The functions mnstr_write{Sht,Int,Lng,Hge} and their Array variants
  now swap bytes of the written values if the stream is set to swap bytes
  (i.e. big-endian on a little-endian machine and v.v.).
- stream: Removed defines ST_ASCII, ST_BIN, ST_READ, ST_WRITE from stream.h.
- stream: Changed function mnstr_set_byteorder(stream, char) to
  mnstr_set_bigendian(stream, bool) where the second argument should
  be `true' for specifying that the stream is bigendian.  This sets an
  internal flag whether or not to swap bytes which can be retrieved
  with mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream).
- stream: Changed function `int mnstr_byteorder(stream)' to `bool
  mnstr_get_swapbytes(stream)'; it now returns whether bytes are
  swapped.
- stream: Changed function `int mnstr_type(stream)' to `bool
  mnstr_isbinary(stream)'.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- mapilib: Removed function mapi_cache_shuffle.
- mapilib: Removed function mapi_stream_query.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- buildtools: We now also build the Python 3 integration packages for Fedora, Debian,
  Ubuntu, and Windows (not for Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04, or EPEL 6 and 7
  which are too old).

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: Function PROPdestroy now takes a BAT* parameter.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- gdk: A whole bunch of functions now take a bool argument instead of an
  int argument.  Some functions now return a bool instead of an int.
  In all these cases, the int was used as a Boolean value.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: The sys.functions table now has an extra column called "system" of
  type BOOLEAN whose value is TRUE for system functions (i.e. functions
  that should not be dumped).  The table sys.systemfunctions has been
  changed to a view and is now officially deprecated.

* Fri Jan  4 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.33.1-20190405
- sql: Extended merge tables with partitioning using a predicate:
  > CREATE MERGE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (... columns ...)
  [ PARTITION BY { RANGE | VALUES }
  { ON '(' column_name ')' | USING '(' expression ')' } ]
  The partitioning can occur by range or list of values using one of
  the table's columns or an expression. The domain of the partitioning
  scheme will be covered by each child table added with alter statements
  depending if the table is partitioned by range or list of values:
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION IN '(' expression [ ',' ... ] ')' [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION BETWEEN { RANGE MINVALUE | expression } AND
  { RANGE MAXVALUE | expression } [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION WITH NULL
  When updating a single partition range/list of values, the SET
  keyword should be used instead of ADD.
  INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements are possible on partitioned
  tables with corresponding validation on each partition domain.
  The system tables sys.table_partitions, sys.range_partitions and
  sys.value_partitions were added to store meta-information about
  each existing partition.

* Thu Jun  7 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- sql: Removed deprecated table producing system functions:
  sys.dependencies_columns_on_functions()
  sys.dependencies_columns_on_indexes()
  sys.dependencies_columns_on_keys()
  sys.dependencies_columns_on_triggers()
  sys.dependencies_columns_on_views()

* Thu May 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.1-20180815
- gdk: A whole bunch of functions that took an int argument that was used as a
  Boolean (true/false) value now take a value of type bool.  The functions
  BATkeyed, BATordered and BATordered_rev now return a bool instead of
  an int.

* Thu May 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.1-20180815
- monetdb5: The lsst module was moved to a separate repository
  (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-lsst/).

* Thu May 31 2018 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.31.1-20180815
- clients: Added a '-f rowcount' option in mclient to repress printing the actual
  data of a resultset, but only print the number of returned tuples

* Thu May 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.1-20180815
- buildtools: On Windows, the separate MonetDB5-Geom installer has been incorporated
  into the main MonetDB5-SQL installer and is therefore no longer
  available as a separate download.

* Thu May 31 2018 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- merovingian: Changed the monetdb profilerstart command to be more robust.  If the
  server or stethoscope crashed before, the pid file is still there,
  so the next time we try to start stethoscope, it will fail.  Now the
  profilerstart command will check if a stethoscope process with the
  recorded pid is running. If not, we start stethoscope, assuming that
  something went wrong before.
- merovingian: Changed the monetdb stop command to try to stop stethoscope before
  stoping the server. The error conditions that can arrise from attempting
  to stop stethoscope are:
  - The database is not running.
  - The profilerlogpath is not set.
  - The profiler.pid file does not exist or is inaccessible.
  - The contents of the profiler.pid are not valid.
  - Shutdown of stethoscope did not succeed.
  - Removing the profiler.pid file failed.
  In all the cases, the attempt to stop the server can continue normally,
  so we actually ignore any errors that rise from the attempt to stop
  stethoscope.

* Thu May 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.1-20180815
- testing: Removed helper programs Mtimeout and MkillUsers: they have long been
  superseded by timeout handling by Mtest.py itself.

* Thu May 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.1-20180815
- gdk: Removed the tdense property: it's function is completely replaced by
  whether or not tseqbase is equal to oid_nil.

* Thu May 31 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- sql: Implemented group_concat(X,Y) aggregate function which also
  concatenates a column of strings X, but using a supplied string Y as
  the separator. This function is also a SQL extension.

* Thu May 31 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.31.1-20180815
- sql: Implemented group_concat(X) aggregate function which concatenates a

  multiple times (once for each DLL we create if the DLL references
  anything from the library) but that doesn't cause the linked library

* Thu Mar  8 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- mapilib: The three mapi_explain* functions and mapi_trace don't return any
  useful information, so they now return void.

* Thu Mar  8 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- utils: The function mcrypt_getHashAlgorithms now returns a static, constant
  string, so the result should not be modified or freed.

* Wed Feb 28 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- clients: ODBC: The driver function SQLProcedureColumns was implemented.

* Fri Feb 16 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: Changed return type of function void_replace_bat from BUN to gdk_return:
  it now only returns whether the operation succeeded or not.
- gdk: Changed the return type of BATroles from void to gdk_return: it can
  fail due to malloc failure.

* Wed Feb 14 2018 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 11.29.1-20180315
- MonetDB: mclient's execution time profiling options and output format have
  been changed. Instead of implicitly via the "--interactive"/"-i"
  option (or when using an interactive mclient console), execution time
  profiling is now controlled via an explicit "--timer=timermode"/"-t
  timermode" command-line option, or a "\t timermode" command in the
  interactive mclient console. The default (also in the interactive
  mclient console) is now timermode "none", i.e., no timing information
  is given. Timermode "clock" activates client-side wall-clock timing
  ("clk") in "human-friendly" format much like the interactive mode did
  before. Timermode "performance" also provides detailed server-side
  timings: "sql" is the time to parse the SQL query, optimize the
  logical relational plan and create the initial physical (MAL) plan;
  "opt" is the time to optimize the physical (MAL) plan; "run" is the
  time to execute the physical (MAL) plan. With timermode "performance"
  all server-side timings and the client-side wall-clock time are given
  in milliseconds (ms). Note that the client-measured wall-clock time
  "clk" is reported per query only when options "--interactive" or
  "--echo" are used, because only then does mclient send individual
  lines (statements) of the SQL script to the server. Otherwise, mclient
  sends the SQL script in large(r) batch(es) to the server, and, thus,
  only the total wall-clock time per batch is measured and reported. The
  server-measured detailed performance timings "sql", "opt", "run" are
  always measured and reported per query. Also, all timing information
  is now given on a separate line and sent to stderr rather than stdout.

* Mon Feb 12 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- buildtools: Added the .pdb files needed for debug symbols to the Windows installer
  for MonetDB/SQL.

* Fri Feb  9 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: Removed functions ALIGNsetH, ALIGNsetT, and CREATEview_ (mind the
  underscore).  The first can easily be replace by using BAThseqbase
  (that's all it did), the second was only used once, and the third can
  be replace by VIEWcreate.

* Fri Feb  9 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- MonetDB: Some types and constants were moved from configure (and hence
  monetdb_config.h) to gdk.h.  In particular, the types "lng" and
  "ulng" have been moved and can therefore no longer be used by code
  that doesn't (ultimately) include gdk.h.  Just use int64_t instead.
  A bunch of format defines have been removed: SZFMT, SSZFMT, PTRFMT,
  PDFMT.  Just use the C standard codes for those (%zu, %zd, %p, %td).
  The define for printing a lng (LLFMT) was also moved.  Use PRId64 for
  printing int64_t in code not using gdk.h.  Removed all references to
  __int64 and long long (use int64_t instead).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: Added new system view: sys.ids which contains all database objects
  ids which can be used in sys.dependencies table.
- sql: Added new system view: sys.dependencies_vw which shows all data of
  sys.dependencies including names on objects, object types and dependency types.
- sql: Added 25 new system views for finding out dependencies between database objects.
  These new dependency views improve, extend and replace the 17
  sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions as previously defined in
  21_dependency_functions.sql. Those sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions
  are now marked as deprecated.
- sql: Added new system view: sys.roles which contains all defined roles.
- sql: Added new system view: sys.var_values which shows the values for
  system variables.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- clients: ODBC: Changed table types as used by SQLTables from "LOCAL TEMPORARY"
  and "GLOBAL TEMPORARY" to "LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE" and "GLOBAL TEMPORARY
  TABLE" respectively.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- clients: ODBC: Initial support for the HUGEINT type in SQL was added.  Any value
  with type HUGEINT can be retrieved in a C variable with type SQL_C_CHAR
  or SQL_C_WCHAR.  A value of type HUGEINT can be retrieved in other C
  types as long as they fit, the largest C type supported being a 64 bit
  integer (equivalent to BIGINT).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- monetdb5: Implemented function pcre.replace_first which is like pcre.replace,
  except it only replaces the first match.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: Removed unused functions BATmemsize and BATvmsize.
- gdk: Removed the tnodense property: it was maintained but never actually
  used, not even stored.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: Added support for COMMENT ON statements using SQL syntax:
   COMMENT ON { SCHEMA | TABLE | VIEW | COLUMN | INDEX | SEQUENCE |
              FUNCTION | PROCEDURE | AGGREGATE | FILTER FUNCTION | LOADER }
        qname IS { 'my description text' | NULL | '' } ;
  For COLUMN the qname can be "table_name"."column_name" or fully qualified
  as in: "schema_name"."table_name"."column_name".
  For FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, AGGREGATE, FILTER FUNCTION and LOADER the qname
  may need to include the signature (argument types) to be able to
  differentiate between multiple overloaded functions which have the same name
  and schema.
  By specifying IS NULL or IS '' you remove the comment for the database object.
  If a database object is dropped, the associated comment is also removed.
  Note: it is not allowed or possible to add comments for temporary tables or
        objects in schema "tmp".
  The sql catalog has been extended with system table: sys.comments.
  The keyword 'COMMENT' has now become a reserved keyword.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: Removed system function sys.environment(). It was a duplicate of system
  function sys.env().

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- stream: The interface of mnstr_fgetpos and mnstr_fsetpos was changed to look
  more like the standard C functions fsetpos and fgetpos: they both have
  a second argument "pointer to fpos_t".

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- clients: The functions in the mapi library that require 64 bit integers now
  use the standard type int64_t instead of the non-standard mapi_int64.
  This requires a compilation environment that has the stdint.h include
  file (standardized in C99).  Compilation of the library also requires
  the inttypes.h include file (also standardized in C99).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: Implemented behavior for DROP SCHEMA my_schema RESTRICT command.
  Previously the RESTRICT keyword was accepted but not obeyed. It would
  always do a CASCADE operation.  Also the default behavior of DROP SCHEMA
  my_schema command is now changed into RESTRICT behavior (was CASCADE).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: The NIL representation of the internal flt and dbl types was changed
  from the smallest representable finite value to NaN (not-a-number).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: The internal NULL representation of the REAL (FLOAT) and DOUBLE
  types was changed from the smallest representable finite value to NaN
  (not-a-number).

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- testing: Added a --data_path option to Mtest.py that defines an external data
  repository. See the commit message of c484932c7fd8 for more info.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: Changed the interface of ATOMformat and VALformat: they now return a
  pointer to the allocated string.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- gdk: The length "method" for atoms now returns a size_t, the "len" field of
  a ValRecord is now a size_t, the "size" field of the atomDesc structure
  is now unsigned short.
- gdk: Removed the "align" field from the ATOM descriptor (atomDesc) structure.
- gdk: The atomtostr and atomfromstr "methods" for atoms now return ssize_t
  and require a pointer to size_t for the size of the buffer.
- gdk: The atom tostr and fromstr "methods" now always return -1 on error.
  A return value greater than 0 is normal, a return value of 0 is not
  normal, but technically not an error.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.29.1-20180315
- sql: A column default value can be used in a UPDATE statement: UPDATE tname
  SET cname = DEFAULT, and INSERT statements: INSERT INTO tname VALUES
  (..., DEFAULT, ...)
- sql: Added support for TRUNCATE statements conforming to the SQL:2008 standard:
   TRUNCATE [ TABLE ] qname [ CONTINUE IDENTITY | RESTART IDENTITY ]
            [ RESTRICT | CASCADE ]
  In a TRUNCATE statement a 'CONTINUE IDENTITY' or 'RESTART IDENTITY'
  clause can be passed to restart or not, being the former the default one.
  The 'CASCADE' option instructs to truncate referencing table(s) also if
  the referencing table(s) have foreign key references to this table.
  The default behavior is 'RESTRICT'.
  Note: it is possible to use TRUNCATE statements in a transaction and
  thus to rollback the effects of a truncate.
  The keywords 'TRUNCATE' and 'CONTINUE' have now become reserved keywords.
- sql: Added possibility to GRANT or REVOKE a TRUNCATE privilege to a user or role.
- sql: Added possibility to define a TRIGGER on a TRUNCATE event.
- sql: Added possibility to specify 'OR REPLACE' in following CREATE commands:
   CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW qname ...
   CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER qname ...
- sql: Added possibility to specify 'IF EXIST' in following DROP commands:
   DROP AGGREGATE [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP FILTER FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP LOADER [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP PROCEDURE [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...
   DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] qname ...

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.29.1-20180315
- monetdb5: The EXPLAIN command now shows all the MAL type resolutions, because in
  general users may not be aware of their signatures.  It also simplifies
  programs to analyze such plans.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- monetdb5: Implemented versions of group.(sub)group(done) that don't return
  a histogram.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- stream: Removed function wbstream.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions streams.socketRead, streams.socketReadBytes,
  streams.socketWrite, and streams.socketWriteBytes.
- monetdb5: Removed MAL functions streams.openRead(s:streams):streams and
  streams.openWrite(s:streams):streams.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- stream: Removed functions udp_rastream and udp_wastream.
- stream: Removed functions socket_rstream and socket_wstream.
- stream: Removed functions append_wstream and append_wastream.
- stream: Removed functions mnstr_rstream and mnstr_wstream.

- merovingian: Add daemon commands for starting/stopping collection of profiler
  (stethoscope) logs.

* Fri Feb  2 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- mapilib: The functions mapi_error_str and mapi_result_error now return const char
  * instead of plain char * to indicate that the returned data belongs
  to the library and should not be changed or freed by the application.
- mapilib: New function const char *mapi_result_errorcode(MapiHdl) which returns
  the SQLSTATE code if available when an error has occurred.

- clients: Add a new pretty printing option to stethoscope
  Running stethoscope with the flag -j will produce not pretty printed
  output (one json object per line). Running with the -y flag will produce
  pretty printed output. Running with neither will produce the legacy,
  line oriented format

- buildtools: The Windows installers (*.msi files) are now created using the WiX
  Toolset.
- buildtools: The Windows binaries are now built using Visual Studio 2015.  Because of
  this, you may need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual
  Studio 2015 before being able to run MonetDB.

* Fri Jul  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.3-20170725

* Mon May 29 2017 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.27.1-20170705
- merovingian: Added handling of a dbextra property per database at the daemon
  level. The user can set the dbextra property for a database using the
  command:  $ monetdb set dbextra=<path> <database> and the daemon will
  make sure to start the new server using the correct
  --dbextra parameter.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- monetdb5: The "sub" prefix of many functions, both at the MAL and the C level,
  has been removed.

* Mon May 29 2017 Mark Raasveldt <m.raasveldt@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- MonetDB: Added a new server-side protocol implementation. The new protocol
  is backwards compatible with the old protocol. Clients can choose
  whether they want to use the old or the new protocol during the initial
  handshake with the server. The new protocol is a binary column-based
  protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when
  transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports
  compression using Snappy or LZ4.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: Improved error checking in the logger code (dealing with the write-ahead
  log); changed return types a several functions from int to gdk_return
  (i.e., they now return GDK_SUCCEED or GDK_FAIL).  The logger no longer
  calls GDKfatal on error.  Instead the caller is responsible for dealing
  with errors.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- sql: Made the operator precedence of % equal to those of * and /.  All three

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: BATsort may now create an order index as a by product.
- gdk: Quantile calculations now use the order index if available (and use
  BATsort otherwise, producing an order index).
- gdk: Quantiles calculate a position in the sorted column.  If this position
  is not an integer, we now choose the nearest position, favoring the
  lower if the distance to the two adjacent positions is equal (round
  down to nearest integer).

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- MonetDB: Removed GSL module: it's now a separate (extension) package.
  See https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-gsl/.
- MonetDB: The PCRE library is now optional for systems that support POSIX regular
  expressions.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705

* Mon May 29 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.27.1-20170705
- MonetDB: Added 5 new sys schema tables: function_languages, function_types,
  key_types, index_types and privilege_codes.  They are pre-loaded with
  static content and contain descriptive names for the various integer
  type and code values.  See also sql/scripts/51_sys_schema_extension.sql

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- monetdb5: Changed the interfaces of the AUTH* functions: pass values, not pointers
  to values.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: Replaced BBPincref/BBPdecref with BBPfix/BBPunfix for physical reference
  count and BBPretain/BBPrelease for logical reference count maintenance.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: Removed automatic conversion of 32-bit OIDs to 64 bits on 64-bit
  architectures.

- monetdb5: group.subgroup is now called group.group if it is not refining a group.
  Both group.group and group.subgroup now also have variants with a
  candidate list.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- clients: The mclient and msqldump programs lost compatibility with old
  mserver5 versions (pre 2014) which didn't have a "system" column in
  the sys.schemas table.
- clients: The mclient and msqldump programs lost compatibility with ancient
  mserver5 versions (pre 2011) which didn't have the sys.systemfunctions
  table.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: BATappend now takes an optional (NULL if not used) candidate list for
  the to-be-appended BAT.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- gdk: New function BATkeyed(BAT *b) that determines (possibly using a hash
  table) whether all values in b are distinct.

* Mon May 29 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- clients: Removed the "array" and "quick" functions from the mapi library.
  To be precise, the removed functions are: mapi_execute_array,
  mapi_fetch_field_array, mapi_prepare_array, mapi_query_array,
  mapi_quick_query, mapi_quick_query_array, and mapi_quick_response.

* Mon May 29 2017 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- monetdb5: The allocation schemes for MAL blocks and Variables has been turned
  into block-based.  This reduces the number of malloc()/free() calls.

* Mon May 29 2017 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- sql: Protect against runaway profiler events If you hit a barrier block
  during profiling, the JSON event log may quickly become unwieldy. Event
  production is protected using a high water mark, which ensures that
  never within the single execution of MAL block the instruction causes
  excessive event records.

* Mon May 29 2017 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- clients: Added a more elaborate \help command for SQL expressions.

* Tue Feb 28 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.11-20170313
- gdk: Fixed a bug when appending string bats that are fully duplicate
  eliminated.  It could happend that the to-be-appended bat had an empty
  string at an offset and at that same offset in the to-be-appended-to bat
  there happened to be a (sequence of) NULL(s).  Then this offset would be
  used, even though it might nog be the right offset for the empty string
  in the to-be-appended-to bat.  This would result in multiple offsets for
  the empty string, breaking the promise of being duplicate eliminated.

- gdk: The tnokey values must now be 0 if it is not known whether all values
  in a column are distinct.
- gdk: The 2-bit tkey field in the bat descriptor has been split into two
  single bit fields: tkey and tunique.  The old tkey&BOUND2BTRUE value
  is now stored in tunique.

* Wed Oct 26 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214

  types).

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- MonetDB: The Perl, PHP, and Python clients, and the JDBC driver each now have
  their own repositories and release cycles.  The Python client is
  maintained by Gijs Molenaar on Github
  (https://github.com/gijzelaerr/pymonetdb), the other clients are
  maintained by CWI/MonetDB on our own server
  (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-java,
  https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-perl,

  on a 64 bit architecture.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.25.1-20161214
- sql: The syntax of bat.new(:oid,:any) has been changed by dropping the
  superflous :oid.  All BATs are now binary associations between a void
  column and a materialized value column.  (except for the internal
  :bat[:void,:void] representation of simple oid ranged tails.)

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: Removed BATderiveTailProps and BATderiveProps.  Just set the properties
  you know about, or use BATsettrivprop.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: Removed the macro BUNfirst.  It can be replaced by 0.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: Changed BATroles by removing the argument to set the name of the
  head column.
- gdk: The head column is now completely gone.  MonetDB is completely
  "headless".
- gdk: The format of the BBP.dir file was simplified.  Since the head column
  is VOID, the only value that needs to be stored is the head seqbase.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- monetdb5: Removed bat.setColumn with two arguments and bat.setRole.  Use
  bat.setColumn with one argument instead.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: BATs now only have a single (logical) name.
- gdk: The function BATmirror is gone.  The HEAD column is always VOID (with
  a non-nil seqbase) and the TAIL column carries the data.  All functions
  that deal with data work on the TAIL column.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: BATkey now works on the TAIL column instead of the HEAD column.
- gdk: Replaced BATseqbase with BAThseqbase and BATtseqbase, the former for
  setting the seqbase on the HEAD, the latter for setting the seqbase
  on the TAIL.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- monetdb5: Removed function BKCappend_reverse_val_wrap: it was unused.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: Replaced function BATnew with COLnew with slightly different arguments:
  the first argument of COLnew is the SEQBASE of the head column (which
  is always VOID).

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- gdk: The "wrd" type has been removed from GDK and MAL.  The type was defined
  to be a 32 bit integer on 32 bit architectures and a 64 bit integer
  on 64 bit architectures.  We now generally use "lng" (always 64 bits)
  where "wrd" was used.

* Fri Oct  7 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- monetdb5: The "wrd" type has been removed from GDK and MAL.  The type was defined

- java: Corrected PROCEDURE_TYPE output value of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures().
  It used to return procedureReturnsResult. Now it returns procedureNoResult.
  Corrected ORDINAL_POSITION output value of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns().
  It used to start with 0, but as procedures do not return a result value it now
  starts with 1 for all the procedure arguments, as defined by the JDBC API.
- java: Improved output of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures(). The REMARKS
  column now contains the procedure definition as stored in sys.functions.func.
  The SPECIFIC_NAME column now contains the procedure unique identifier as
  stored in sys.functions.id. This allows the caller to retrieve the specific
  overloaded procedure which has the same name, but different arguments.
  Also improved output of method DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns().
  The SPECIFIC_NAME column now contains the procedure unique identifier as
  stored in sys.functions.id. This allows the caller to retrieve the proper
  arguments of the specific overloaded procedure by matching the SPECIFIC_NAME
  value.

- java: ResultSet.setFetchSize(): added a dummy implementation to get rid
  of the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. In MonetDB, it does not
  make sense to set the fetch size of a result set. If one really
  wants to set the fetch size, one should use Statement.setFetchSize()
  instead.

* Thu Apr 21 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Fixed resource leak in ResultSetMetaData. It created and cached a ResultSet
  object for each column but never closed the ResultSet objects.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Corrected DatabaseMetaData methods which accept a catalog filter argument.
  Those methods will now filter the results on the specified catalog name,
  whereas previously the catalog filter argument was ignored.
- java: Corrected output of column KEY_SEQ of DatabaseMetaData methods:
  getPrimaryKeys(), getImportedKeys(), getExportedKeys() and
  getCrossReference(). It now starts at 1 instead of 0 previously.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Corrected DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() by returning 2 instead of 3 columns.
- java: Improved DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() by returning two additional
  columns: IS_AUTOINCREMENT and IS_GENERATEDCOLUMN.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed BATconst.  Use BATconstant instead.
- gdk: Changed BATconstant.  It now has a new first argument with the seqbase
  for the head column.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Improved DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo(). It now returns better information
  on LITERAL_PREFIX, LITERAL_SUFFIX, CREATE_PARAMS, CASE_SENSITIVE,
  FIXED_PREC_SCALE and MAXIMUM_SCALE for some data types. Also the returned rows
  are now ordered by DATA_TYPE, TYPE_NAME, PRECISION as required by the specs.
  Also corrected output column names "searchable" into "SEARCHABLE" and
  "MAXIMUM SCALE" into "MAXIMUM_SCALE" to match the JDBC specification.
- java: Corrected DatabaseMetaData.getPseudoColumns(). It used to return 12 empty rows.
  Now it returns no rows as MonetDB does not have pseudo columns.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- clients: The Ruby client is now in a separate repository
  (http://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-ruby) and released independently.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Implemented method DatabaseMetaData.getClientProperties(). It used to always
  return a resultset with 4 completely empty rows.  It now returns a
  resultset with the possible connection properties.
- java: Implemented method DatabaseMetaData.getUDTs(). It used to return an empty
  resultset. Now it returns the User Defined Types such as inet, json, url and uuid.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- buildtools: A new package MonetDB-lidar (Fedora) or libmonetdb5-server-lidar
  (Debian/Ubuntu) has been created to work with LiDAR data.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- geom: The geom module has been completely overhauled.  Types are now specified
  as GEOMETRY(POINT) instead of POINT, old functions have been removed,
  new ones introduced.  However, even with all the changes, a database
  upgrade should still be possible (as always, make a backup first).

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Extended the storage() table producing function to also accept
  storage([schemaname [, tablename [, columnname]]])

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Corrected the returned table types in DatabaseMetaData.getTableTypes().
  It now returns all 10 table types (as stored in sys.table_types) instead
  of the previously 8 hardcoded table types.
  For old MonetDB servers which do not have the sys.table_types table,
  the old behavior is retained.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Implemented methods DatabaseMetadata.getProcedures() and
  DatabaseMetadata.getProcedureColumns(). They used to return an empty resultset.
  Now they return the expected Procedures and ProcedureColumns.
  Also getProcedureColumns() now returns a resultset with all 20 columns
  instead of 13 columns previously.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Method getFunctionColumns() in DatabaseMetadata used to throw an
  SQLException:  getFunctionColumns(String, String, String, String) is
  not implemented.
  This method is now implemented and returns a resultset.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Method getFunctions() in DatabaseMetadata used to throw an SQLException:
   SELECT: no such column 'functions.sql'
  This has been corrected. It now returns a resultset as requested.
- java: The resultsets of DatabaseMetadata methods now no longer return a
  value for the *_CAT columns as MonetDB does not support Catalogs.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- buildtools: Implemented a systemd configuration file for a monetdbd.service
  on systems that support it (Fedora, newer Ubuntu).

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed BATmmap.  It was no longer used.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.23.1-20160601
- java: Fixed a memory leak in MonetDatabaseMetaData.java for a static cache
  which kept references to closed Connection objects.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: The :bat[:oid,:any] type descriptor has been turned into its columnar
  version :bat[:any]

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Converted the *.mal scripts into *.malC versions to prepare for removal
  of the mserver console.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: BUNdelete and BATdel don't accept a foce argument and only allow
  deleting values that have not yet been committed.  BUNdelete exchanges
  the deleted value with the last value (if the deleted value isn't the
  last value).  BATdel compacts the BAT by shifting values after the
  deleted values up.  The list of to-be-deleted values in BATdel must
  be sorted and unique.
- gdk: Removed BUNreplace from list of exported functions.  It wasn't used,
  and there is still BUNinplace and void_inplace that do more-or-less
  the same thing.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Changed BATderiveHeadProps to BATderiveTailProps (and it now works on
  the tail column).
- gdk: Removed unused functions BATalpha, BATdelta, and BATprev.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Removed functions mat.hasMoreElements, mat.info, mat.mergepack,
  mat. newIterator, mat.project, mat.pack2, mat.sortReverse, mat.sort,
  and mat.slice.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed function VIEWcombine.  Use BATdense instead.
- gdk: Removed "left" parameter from BUNinplace.  It wasn't used since the
  BAT it works on is dense headed.
- gdk: Created function BATdense to easily create a [void,void] BAT with
  specified seqbases for head and tail and a count.
- gdk: Removed function BATmark.  When all head columns are dense, BATmark
  basically only created a new [void,void] BAT.
- gdk: Renamed BATsubsort to BATsort.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Removed grouped aggregate functions from the aggr module in which the
  groups were indicated by the head column of the bat to be aggregated.
  Use the interface with a separate group bat instead.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: The server now stops executing a query when the client disconnects.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed "sub" from the names of the function BATsubselect,
  BATthetasubselect, BATsubcross, BATsubleftjoin, BATsubouterjoin,
  BATsubthetajoin, BATsubsemijoin, BATsubdiff, BATsubjoin, BATsubbandjoin,
  BATsubrangejoin, and BATsubunique.
- gdk: Removed BATsubleftfetchjoin: it was not used.
- gdk: Removed BATcross1.  Use BATsubcross instead.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Removed algebra.join.  Use algebra.subjoin instead.
- monetdb5: Removed algebra.antijoin.  Use algebra.subantijoin or
  algebra.subthetajoin instead.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: The MAL function 'leftfetchjoin' is renamed to its relational algebra
  version 'projection'

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: The generic property handling scheme has been removed. It was used in
  just a few places, for widely different purposes and contained cruft.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Removed functions str.iconv and str.codeset.  Internally, strings are
  always in UTF-8 encoding, so we can't allow code set conversions.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- sql: Disallow GRANT <some-user> TO <role-or-use>.  Only explicitly
  created roles can be granted.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.23.1-20160601
- sql: Extended grantable schema privileges: when a user is granted the
  "sysadmin" role, the user now hcan not only create schemas, but
  also drop schemas.
- sql: Introduced COPY INTO/ COPY FROM global privileges. These privileges
  allows other users than 'monetdb' to be granted the privileges
  to use the MonetDB bulk data loading/exporting features, i.e.,
  COPY FROM <file> and COPY INTO <file>.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed all versions of the SORTloop macro.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- monetdb5: Removed algebra.like with a BAT argument.  Use algebra.likesubselect
  instead.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Removed Batkdiff.  Use BATsubdiff instead.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601
- gdk: Implemented BATsubdiff which returns a list of OIDs (sorted, i.e. usable
  as candidate list) of tuples in the left input whose value does not
  occur in the right input.

* Tue Apr  5 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.1-20160601

  where crashes occurred.  The problem was that internally data wasn't
  always marked dirty when it was being changed, causing later processing
  to not deal with the changed data correctly.

  (auxillary changed to auxiliary).

* Tue Jan 13 2015 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.9-20150123
- clients: Changes to the Perl interface, thanks to Stefan O'Rear:
  1. removes "use sigtrap", because this has global effects and should
  not be used by modules, only by the application.
  2. allows Perl 5.8.1+ Unicode strings to be passed to quote() and
  included in statements (UTF-8 encoded, as expected by Monet's str
  module)
  3. quote and unquote now use the same quoting rules as the MonetDB
  server, allowing for all characters except NUL to be round-tripped
  4. several character loops have been reimplemented in regex for much
  greater performance
  5. micro-optimizations to the result fetch loop
  6. block boundaries are preserved in piggyback data so that Xclose is
  not appended or prepended to a SQL command
  7. diagnostic messages #foo before a result header are ignored, this
  is necessary to use recycler_pipe
  8. fail quickly and loudly if we receive a continuation prompt (or any
  other response that starts with a non-ASCII character)
  9. header lines must start with %, not merely contain %, fixing a bug
  when querying a table where string values contain %
  10. after closing a large resultset, account for the fact that a reply
  will come and do not lose sync
  11. allow a MAPI_TRACE environment variable to dump wire protocol
  frames to standard output
  12. fixes maximum MAPI block size to match the server limit of 16k.
  previously would crash on blocks larger than 16k

* Fri Nov 14 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.5-20141120
- sql: A number of bugs were fixed in the code to upgrade a database from
  previous releases.  This version should fix the upgrade of a database
  that had been upgraded to the Oct2014 release, but also properly
  upgrade directly from Jan2014 and Feb2013 releases.

* Fri Nov  7 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.5-20141120
- buildtools: The libraries included in the Windows installers have been upgraded.
  We now use libxml2-2.9.2, openssl-1.0.1j, pcre-8.36, and zlib-1.2.8.

* Wed Nov  5 2014 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.19.5-20141120
- gdk: Fixed some problems with BATsample.  It was possible for BATsample to
  return a value that was just beyond the end of the sampled BAT.  Also,
  on some systems the range of the rand() function is rather limited
  (0..32767) and trying to get a sample larger than this range would
  result in an infinite loop.

  that should return TRUE if the timeout should cause the function to
  abort or continue what it was doing.

- monetdb5: Fixed a problem that when the server is using all available threads
  for a query, it was not possible to attach another client and have
  it execute even the smallest query.  This is fixed by creating extra
  threads for each client entering the fray at the cost of having more
  threads that execute queries.  But at least there is guaranteed progress
  for all clients (modulo the operating system scheduler).  See bug #3258.

* Tue Nov 19 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.15.19-20131120

* Wed Nov  6 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.15.19-20131120
- clients: ODBC: Fixed interpretation SQL_C_SLONG/SQL_C_ULONG/SQL_C_LONG to
  refer to a 32 bit integer always (i.e. "int" on 64 bit architectures
  despite the name and the Microsoft documentation).  This seems to be
  the consensus.
- clients: ODBC: Fixed transaction level: MonetDB only supports the highest level
  (SQL_TXN_SERIALIZABLE), so setting the transaction level can be accepted
  and ignored.

- gdk: Removed the heap cache.  Since the fix for bug 3323 which made that
  the cache was actually getting used, bug 3376 made clear that it didn't
  work very well.  In addition, on Linux at least, the heap cache slows

- testing: enabled "top-level" Mtest.py
  So far, while Mtest.py could be called in any subdirectory of the MonetDB
  source tree (and could then run all tests in the entire sub-tree),
  it was not possible to call Mtest.py in the top-level MonetDB source
  directory to run all tests.  Instead, to run all tests, Mtest.py had to
  be called at least 4 times, once in each of these directories: "clients",
  "monetdb5", "sql", "geom".
  Now, it is possible to call Mtest.py once in the top-level MonetDB source
  directory to run all tests in one go.
  The behaviour of calling Mtest.py in any subdirectory, including the
  four mentioned above, did not changed, other than that now obsolete
  command line options "-p / --package <package>" and "-5 / --monetdb5"
  have been removed.

* Tue Jan 15 2013 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.15.1-20130212
- monetdb5: The scheduler of mserver5 was changed to use a fixed set of workers to
  perform the work for all connected clients.  Previously, each client
  connection had its own set of workers, easily causing resource problems
  upon multiple connections to the server.

* Mon Sep 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.13.1-20121010
- gdk: Removed the gdk_embedded (and embedded) option.  The code wasn't tested
  and most likely non-functional.

* Mon Sep 17 2012 Gijs Molenaar <g.j.molenaar@uva.nl> - 11.13.1-20121010
- clients: all strings returned by python2 are unicode, removed use_unicode option
- clients: python2 and 3 type convertion speed improvements
- clients: python2 uses new styl objects now (bug #3104)
- clients: split python2 and python3

* Mon Sep 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.13.1-20121010
- gdk: BAT-of-BATs is no longer allowed.  It was already not allowed to
  make these types of BATs persistent, but now they can't be created at
  all anymore.

* Mon Sep 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.13.1-20121010

- Rebuilt.

* Fri Sep  7 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.9-20120911
- monetdb5: Changed the way nclients maximum was calculated to avoid 'out of client
  slots' errors way before the maximum was reached.

- Rebuilt.

* Thu Aug  2 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.7-20120813
- merovingian: Starting a server now waits for as long as the server needs to possibly
  recover, bug #3134.  In case of a long wait, the monetdbd logfile
  gives extra information on what the server is doing to recover.
- merovingian: Fixed a crash of monetdbd when local databases were unshared, bug #3135

* Thu Aug  2 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.7-20120813

* Tue Jul 17 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.7-20120813
- clients: mclient no longer prints the SQLSTATE at the start of each error
  returned by the SQL-server.

* Tue Jul 10 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.11.5-20120710
- Rebuilt.

* Mon Jul  9 2012 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.11.5-20120710
- gdk: Fixed intermittent problem that joins and selects return incorrect
  results and possibly inconsistent databases. The problems only occurred
  after a series of queries and updates, therefore it was hard to reproduce.

* Mon Jul 09 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.11.3-20120709
- Rebuilt.

* Sat Jul  7 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.3-20120709

  over time.

* Fri Jul 06 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- Rebuilt.

- clients: ODBC: Fixed a bug where SQLNativeSql expected a statment handle instead
  of a connection handle.

* Thu Jun 14 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.1-20120706
- monetdb5: Crackers code has been removed.  Development continues in the holindex
  branch.

* Wed Jun 13 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.1-20120706

- buildtools: Removed --enable-bits option from configure.

* Thu Jun  7 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- buildtools: Split the MonetDB-client-ruby RPM package into two and named them in
  accordance with the Fedora packaging guidelines as rubygem-<gem-name>.

* Thu Jun  7 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- gdk: The sorted property, which was used to maintain whether a column in
  a BAT was sorted or reverse sorted, has been replaced by a pair of
  properties, sorted and revsorted.  These new properties can be set
  independently (unlike the old sorted property), and so if both are set,
  the column must be constant.  In addition, internal property checking
  has been overhauled.  Now, when a property is set incorrectly, and
  when assertions are enabled, an assertion will go off.  There is also
  a function which can derive properties.

* Thu Jun  7 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- gdk: Implemented proper overflow checking on all arithmetic operations.

  misalignments in tabular result views.  For the time being, tabs are
  now represented as a single space in tabular view.

* Thu May 17 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.9.7-20120607
- gdk: Limit number of detected CPU cores to 16 on 32-bits systems to avoid
  running quickly out of addressable resources followed by a kill from
  the OS.

* Wed May 16 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.9.5-20120516
- Rebuilt.

* Tue May 15 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.9.5-20120516

* Mon Mar 12 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.9.1-20120418
- gdk: The type "chr" has been removed.
  chr has long been superseded by bte for 1 byte arithmetic plus it is
  pretty useless to hold single characters since we use Unicode and
  thus only a tiny subset of the supported character set would fit.

* Mon Mar 12 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.9.1-20120418
- monetdb5: The type "chr" has been removed.
  chr has long been superseded by bte for 1 byte arithmetic plus it is
  pretty useless to hold single characters since we use Unicode and

* Wed Feb 22 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- buildtools: Fixed some of the package names for Debian/Ubuntu.  Packages for
  libraries should contain the major number of the library version number.
  This was not always the case.

* Mon Feb 20 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.7-20120224
- java: Fixed bug in DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() method that caused an SQL

* Fri Feb 17 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.7-20120224
- merovingian: Fixed a bug in the multiplex-funnel where certain clients would abort
  on responses for update queries.

* Fri Feb 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- sql: Fixed a crash that happened at the end of a database upgrade to the
  Dec2011 database scheme.  The crash happened during cleanup after the
  database was upgraded, so it was merely inconvenient.

* Wed Feb 15 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- sql: Stripped off implementation-specific parts from error messages before
  they get presented to the user.

- buildtools: On Debian and Ubuntu, install Python modules in dist-packages instead
  of site-packages.  This fixed bug 2997.

* Mon Jan 30 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.7-20120224
- merovingian: Fixed problem where version and mserver properties for monetdbd were
  not always successfully retrieved.  Bug #2982.
- merovingian: Fixed problem where shutdown of monetdbd would lead to shutting down
  database 'control' which does not exist.  Bug #2983.
- merovingian: Fixed issue causing (harmless) 'error reading from control channel'
  messages.  Bug #2984.
- merovingian: Resolved problem where remote start/stop/etc. commands with monetdb

  could cause odd stack traces when used by multiple threads at the
  same time, bug #2950.

* Mon Dec 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: JDBC now implements JDBCv4.1 which makes it possible to be built with
  Java 7 and up.  JDBCv4.1 is a maintenance release of JDBCv4, and hence
  can be compiled with Java 6, although the added methods obviously are
  not part of the java.sql interfaces.

* Sun Dec 11 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: SQLExceptions thrown now carry a SQLSTATE.  Until the server starts
  sending correct SQLSTATEs for all errors, server originated errors
  without SQLSTATE are considered generic data exceptions (22000).

* Sat Dec 10 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: Fixed a bug where closing ResultSets and PreparedStatements could lead
  to errors on concurrent running queries using the same Connection due
  to a race condition.

* Thu Dec  8 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: Changed version scheme of JDBC driver and MCL jar to be more standard,

- clients: ODBC: Fixed SQLNumResultCols and SQLDescribeCol to return useful
  information after a call to SQLPrepare and before any SQLExecute.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: mclient: The exact interpretation of the -i (--interactive) option
  and the - filename argument have changed.  The - filename argument
  means read from standard input and no longer implies that no \
  interpretation is done on the input.  Instead, \ interpretation is done
  if either standard input is a terminal, or if the -i option is given.
  The -i option no longer causes mclient to read from standard input.
  It only means to do \ interpretation when reading from standard input.
  Use the - filename argument to read from standard input.  Note that
  if no -s option is specified and no filename arguments are present,
  mclient still reads from standard input.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- sql: mclient: The csv output format can now also be of the form csv=c and
  csv+c where c is the column separator.  The form with csv+ produces
  a single header line with column names.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: ODBC: Improved internal query for SQLSpecialColumns.  Before, the query
  returned all columns taking part in a PRIMARY KEY *and* all columns
  taking part in a UNIQUE constraint.  Now it returns only one or the
  other set.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- sql: Changed a bug where the sign() function returned the same type as its
  argument instead of always an INTEGER.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: ODBC: The database name is now used as the catalog name throughout.
  Functions that return a catalog name return the database name, and
  functions that match on catalog name match it with the database name.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: ODBC: Implemented an easier way to create a log file of interactions
  with the ODBC driver.  You can now add a connection attribute
  "LOGFILE=filename" to the connection string parameter of
  SQLBrowseConnect and SQLDriverConnect, and to the relevant part of
  the Windows registry or odbc.ini file.  This value is only used if
  there is no environment variable ODBCDEBUG.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: The embedded monet instance capability of MonetConnection was removed.
- java: Bump JDBC version to 2.0 (Liberica).  JDBC now implements JDBCv4 which
  makes it possible to be built with Java 6 and up.  Java 5 and before
  are no longer supported, and can use the 1.x releases of the driver.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: Quoting of object names for mclient's \d command is now more flexible
  and consistent with standard SQL quoting rules, bug #2846.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- merovingian: monetdb get output is now grouped by database instead of by property

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- merovingian: Unlike in previous releases, 'monetdbd get mserver' now returns the path
  to the mserver5 binary only for dbfarms that have a running monetdbd,
  instead of only for those that are not served by a monetdbd.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- merovingian: Add nclients property that controls the maximum number of concurrent
  clients allowed to access the database

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- monetdb5: Introduced new variable max_clients that allows to define how many
  concurrent connections are allowed to be made against the database.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: ODBC: Implemented SQLColumnPrivileges function.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- java: INTERVAL columns are now treated as decimals, since they can have
  sub-second precision.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- merovingian: Starting monetdbd without any arguments or without dbfarm is no longer
  supported.  A dbfarm now must be provided for each command.
- merovingian: The control passphrase has been turned into a hash of the password, for
  a more stronger authorisation model as used by mclients.  On upgrade,
  any existing passphrase is converted to the hashed version of the
  passphrase.
- merovingian: The monetdbd controlport option has been removed in favour of a
  boolean control option.  On upgrade, when controlport was set to
  a non-zero value and a passphrase was set, control is set to true,
  or false otherwise.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: Install new program, mnc, which provides netcat functionality, but
  based on MonetDB's communication libraries

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: Report full URI to database instead of just database when available
  in mclient.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- merovingian: The monetdbd discoveryport option has been removed in favour of a
  boolean discovery option.  On upgrade, when discoveryport was set to
  a non-zero value, discovery is set to true, or false otherwise.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- clients: The time format of the timer output can now be controlled with an
  optional argument to the -i option.  ms, s and m force the time to be
  formatted as milliseconds, seconds or minutes + seconds respectively.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- monetdb5: bpm and partitions have been moved to the attic.  It is replaced by
  the partition optimizer, still under construction.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- monetdb5: mal_interpreter.mx Protect against concurrent exceptions If multiple
  parallel blocks access the exception variables and perform GDKfree
  on old messages, then we may enter a case that one thread attempts a
  second free.  Simple lock-based protection is the first line of defense.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- monetdb5: The dataflow optimizer uses a less strict side-effect test for BAT
  new operations and better recognizes trivial plans.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- monetdb5: The MAL debugger next/step operations semantics have been fixed.
  The profiler also now clearly shows entrance/exit of a MAL function.

* Tue Nov 15 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.9-20111115
- Rebuilt.

* Sun Nov  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.9-20111115

- Rebuilt.

* Mon Oct 17 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.5-20111018
- clients: Small improvement to mclient's table rendering for tables without
  any rows.  Previously, the column names in the header could be
  squeezed to very small widths, degrading readability.

* Wed Oct 12 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.5-20111018
- clients: Python DB API connect() function now supports PEP 249-style arguments

  using the -s option is combined with input on standard input (e.g. in
  the construct mclient -s 'COPY INTO t FROM STDIN ...' < file.csv).

* Sun Oct  9 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.5-20111018

- merovingian: monetdbd get status now also reports the version of the running monetdbd

* Fri Oct  7 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.5-20111018
- clients: Fixed bug 2897 where slow (network) reads could cause blocks to not
  be fully read in one go, causing errors in the subsequent use of
  those blocks.  With thanks to Rémy Chibois.

* Thu Oct  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.5-20111018

- merovingian: Fixed a bug in monetdbd where starting a failing database could
  incorrectly be reported as a 'running but dead' database.

* Fri Sep 30 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.5-20111018
- merovingian: To avoid confusion, all occurrences of merovingian were changed into

* Wed Sep 21 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- monetdb5: Fixed a problem where MAL variables weren't properly cleared before
  reuse of the data strucutre.  This problem could cause the data flow
  scheduler to generate dependencies between instructions that didn't
  actually exist, which in turn could cause circular dependencies among
  instructions with deadlock as a result.  Bugs 2865 and 2888.

* Wed Sep 21 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- sql: Fixed a bug when using default values for interval columns.  Bug 2877.

* Mon Sep 19 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- clients: Perl: We now distinguish properly between TABLE and GLOBAL TEMPORARY
  (the latter are recognized by being in the "tmp" schema).
- clients: Perl: fixed a bunch of syntax errors.  This fixes bug 2884.  With thanks
  to Rémy Chibois.
- clients: Perl: Fixed DBD::monetdb table_info and tabletype_info.  This fixes
  bug 2885.  With thanks to Rémy Chibois.

* Fri Sep 16 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- sql: A bug was fixed where deleted rows weren't properly accounted for in
  all operations.  This was bug 2882.
- sql: A bug was fixed which caused an update to an internal table to
  happen too soon.  The bug could be observed on a multicore system
  with a query INSERT INTO t (SELECT * FROM t) when the table t is
  "large enough".  This was bug 2883.

* Tue Sep 13 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.3-20110925
- clients: mclient: fix display of varchar columns with only NULL values.
- clients: Fixed a bug in mclient/msqldump where an internal error occurred during
  dump when there are GLOBAL TEMPORARY tables.

* Wed Sep 07 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Rebuilt.

* Wed Aug 31 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: msqldump now also accepts the database name as last argument on the
  command line (i.e. without -d).

- merovingian: Fixed confusing 'Success' error message for monetdb commands where an
  invalid hostname was given

* Fri Aug 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- merovingian: The path to the mserver5 binary is no longer returned for the mserver
  property with monetdbd get for a dbfarm which is currently served by
  a monetdbd.  Since the called monetdbd needs not to be the same as
  the running monetdbd, the reported mserver5 binary may be incorrect,
  and obviously lead to confusing situations.  Refer to the running
  monetdbd's logfile to determine the mserver5 binary location instead.

* Thu Aug 18 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: Implemented SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID attribute.  The attribute is used
  in SQLColumns, SQLProcedures, and SQLTablePrivileges.
- clients: Implemented SQLTablePrivileges in the ODBC driver.

* Wed Aug 17 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- merovingian: Added -n option to monetdbd start command, which prevents monetdbd
  from forking into the background.

* Wed Aug 10 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- gdk: On Windows and Linux/Unix we can now read databases built on the other
  O/S, as long as the hardware-related architecture (bit size, floating
  point format, etc.) is identical.

* Sat Aug  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- merovingian: Fix incorrect (misleading) path for pidfile in pidfile error message,
  bug #2851

  file system for /var/run.  This fixes bug 2850.

* Fri Aug  5 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: mclient now automatically sets the SQL `TIME ZONE' variable to its
  (the client's) time zone.

* Fri Jul 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- geom: Implemented NULL checks in the geom module.  Now when given NULL
  as input, the module functions return NULL instead of an exception.
  This fixes bug 2814.

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: Removed perl/Cimpl, MonetDB-CLI-MapiLib and MonetDB-CLI-MapiXS
- clients: Switched implementation of MonetDB::CLI::MapiPP to Mapi.pm, and made
  it the default MonetDB::CLI provider.

- buildtools: The default OID size for 64-bit Windows is now 64 bits.  Databases with
  32 bit OIDs are converted automatically.

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: Made Mapi.pm usable with current versions of MonetDB again

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- monetdb5: Make crackers optional and disable by default, since it wasn't used
  normally

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- java: Add so_timeout Driver property to specify a SO_TIMEOUT value for the
  socket in use to the database.  Setting this property to a value in
  milliseconds defines the timeout for read calls, which may 'unlock'
  the driver if the server hangs, bug #2828

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- java: Added a naive implementation for PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream

- merovingian: added status property to get command

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- monetdb5: Authorisation no longer takes scenarios into account.  Access for only
  sql or mal is no longer possible.  Any credentials now mean access to
  all scenarios that the server has available.

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- clients: When the first non-option argument of mclient does not refer to an
  exising file, it now is taken as database name.  This allows to simply
  do `mclient mydb`.

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- java: The obsolete Java-based implementation for PreparedStatements (formerly
  activated using the java_prepared_statements property) has been dropped

* Tue Jul 26 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.7-20110726
- Rebuilt.

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- buildtools: We can now build RPMs on CentOS 6.0.  Since there is no geos library
  on CentOS, we do not support the geom modules there.

* Sat Jul  9 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- gdk: Fixed a problem where appending string BATs could cause enormous growth
  of the string heap.  This fixes bug 2820.

* Fri Jul  8 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- java: Return false from Statement.getMoreResults() instead of a
  NullPointerException when no query has been performed on the Statement
  yet, bug #2833

* Fri Jul  1 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- clients: Fix stethoscope's mod.fcn filter when using multiple targets, bug #2827

* Wed Jun 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- buildtools: We can now also build on Fedora 15.  This required some very minor
  changes.
- buildtools: Changed configure check for OpenSSL so that we can also build on CentOS
  5.6.  We now no longer demand that OpenSSL is at least version 0.9.8f,
  but instead we require that the hash functions we need are supported.

- sql: Fixed pushing select down.

* Mon Jun  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- java: Fixed read-only interpretation.  Connection.isReadOnly now always
  returns false, setReadOnly now generates a warning when called with
  true.  Partly from bug #2818
- java: Allow readonly to be set when autocommit is disabled as well.  Bug #2818

* Tue May 17 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.3-20110517

respect timezones, as partly indicated in bug #2781.

* Wed May 11 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.3-20110517
- monetdb5: Fixed a bug in conversion from string to the URL type.  The bug was
an incorrect call to free().

* Wed Apr 27 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.3-20110517
- geom: Fixed various problems so that now all our tests work correctly on
all our testing platforms.

* Thu Apr 21 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110421
- Rebuilt.

- merovingian: Fix monetdb return code upon failure to start/stop a database

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Rebuilt.

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- gdk: Fixed bugs in antiselect which gave the incorrect result when upper
  and lower bound were equal.  This bug could be triggered by the SQL
  query SELECT * FROM t WHERE x NOT BETWEEN y AND y.

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- sql: Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
  database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
  databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
  first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
  release.

* Tue Apr  5 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.1-20110414
- clients: Plugged a small memory leak occurring upon redirects by the server

- merovingian: The forward property for databases has been removed.  Instead, only
  a global proxy or redirect mode can be set using monetdbd.

* Thu Mar 24 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.1-20110414
- merovingian: monetdbd can no longer log error and normal messages to separate
  logfiles, logging to stdout and stderr is no longer possible either.
- merovingian: The .merovingian_pass file is no longer in use, and replaced by the
  .merovingian_properties file.  Use monetdbd (get|set) passphrase to
  view/edit the control passphrase.  Existing .merovingian_pass files
  will automatically be migrated upon startup of monetdbd.
- merovingian: monetdbd now understands commands that allow to create, start, stop,
  get and set properties on a given dbfarm.  This behaviour is intended
  as primary way to start a MonetDB Database Server, on a given location
  of choice.  monetdbd get and set are the replacement of editing the
  monetdb5.conf file (which is no longer in use as of the Apr2011
  release).  See monetdbd(1).

  or -l is omitted

* Thu Mar 24 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.1-20110414
- monetdb5: mserver5 no longer reads monetdb5.conf upon startup by default.
  Use --config=file to have mserver5 read a configuration on startup

- merovingian: merovingian has been renamed into monetdbd.  Internally, monetdbd keeps
  referring to merovingian for e.g. settings and logfiles.  Merovingian
  has been renamed to make the process more recognisable as part of the
  MonetDB suite.

* Tue Jan  4 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- monetdb5: Improve the performance of remote.put for BAT arguments.  The put
  speed is now roughly equal to the speed of get on a BAT.
