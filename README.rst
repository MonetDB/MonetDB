The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database was originally developed by the `CWI`__ `database
research group`__ (see https://www.monetdb.org/).  Development has now
shifted to the spin-off company `MonetDB Solutions`__.

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open
source, where it is accessible at https://www.monetdb.org/easy-setup/.
Even though development happens mostly in a company, the MonetDB
database system will remain open source.  It is available under the
`Mozilla Public License 2.0`__.

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB source can be found at our
`Mercurial server`__. There is also a `github mirror`__ that is updated
once an hour.

Building
--------

MonetDB is built using the ``cmake`` program.  It is recommended to
build in a directory that is not inside the source tree.  In order to
build, use the following commands when inside your build directory::

  cmake [options] /path/to/monetdb/source
  cmake --build .
  cmake --build . --target install

In order to install into a different directory than the default
``/usr/local``, add the option ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``::

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/monetdb /path/to/monetdb/source
  cmake --build .
  cmake --build . --target install

Build Options
.............

There are many options that can be used to select how MonetDB is to be
built.  Options can be turned ``ON`` or ``OFF`` using a ``-D`` flag on
the first of the ``cmake`` command lines.  Except when specified
otherwise, options are ``ON`` when the relevant libraries can be found.
Available options are:

==============  ===============================================================================================
