RELEASE NOTES
MonetDB JDBC driver version 2.19 (Liberica/MCL-1.13)
Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org>

Release date: 2016-01-05


This JDBC driver is designed for use with MonetDB, a main-memory
database.  For more information see http://www.monetdb.org/.

Within the current implementation not all functionalities of the JDBC
interface are available.  It is believed, however, that this
implementation is rich enough to be suitable for a majority of
application settings.
Note that this driver is JDBC4 compatible, and hence cannot be compiled
with Java 1.5 and earlier.

Below a list of supported features can be found.  Please read this list
if you intend to use this driver.  If you feel some features are
missing, please let us know at our bugtracker:
  http://bugs.monetdb.org/
Feel free to file bugs there as well.


Currently implemented:
  * java.sql.Driver interface
  * javax.sql.DataSource interface (not tested)
  * java.sql.Connection interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - createStatement with result set holdability
    - nativeSQL (there is no query parsing for JDBC escapes yet)
    - prepareCall (CallableStatement not supported)
    - prepareStatement with column indices or names
    - setCatalog (there is no catalog management yet)
    - setHoldability (close/hold cursors over commit is not
      configurable)
    - isReadOnly/setReadOnly (updateable result sets are not supported at
      all)

    NOTE: be sure to check for warnings after setting concurrencies or
          isolation levels; MonetDB currently does not support anything
          else but "fully serializable" transactions.
  * java.sql.Statement interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - cancel/getQueryTimeout/setQueryTimeout (query execution cannot be
      terminated, once started)
    - execute with column indices or names
    - executeUpdate with column indices or names
    - getMaxFieldSize/setMaxFieldSize
    - setCursorName
    - setEscapeProcessing
  * java.sql.PreparedStatement interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - setArray
    - setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setUnicodeStream
    - setBlob
    - setRef, setURI
  * java.sql.ResultSet interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - getArray
    - getAsciiStream, getBinaryStream, getUnicodeStream
    - getRef, getURL
    - all methods related to updateable result sets
  * java.sql.ResultSetMetaData interface
  * java.sql.DatabaseMetaData interface
  * java.sql.SavePoint interface

- Auto-commit behaviour is defined by the server which handles the
  auto-commit.  This is in general in line with the JDBC standard.
