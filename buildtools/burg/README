This is a modified version of Burg.  Please refer to the
file `COPYING' for information on Burg and the applicable

To compile, first run the script
	./bootstrap
then do the usual sequence,
	./configure [--prefix=<install-dir-prefix>]
	make
	make install
(Note: We require GNU make, which might be called "gmake" on some systems.)

Use
	./configure --help
to find out the options you can give to configure.



To format the documentation, type "make doc.dvi" and print the result.

The length of the cost vectors is fixed at 4 for reasons that are
primarily historical.  To change it, edit the definition of DELTAWIDTH
in b.h.

Burg is compiled without optimization by default to avoid problems
with initial installation.  To improve burg's performance, add '-O' to
CFLAGS in the Makefile and rebuild burg with a high quality optimizing
compiler.
