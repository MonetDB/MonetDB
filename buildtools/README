This directory contains tools that are needed to build (parts of) the
MonetDB suite.

Mx - The tool to extract sources and documentation from .mx files.
mel - The MonetDB Extension Language tool.
autogen - A tool to create Makefiles from Makefile.ag.

Mx is needed by many other packages and doesn't itself depend on
anything else, so build Mx first.

To build the various tools (except for autogen), change into the
tool's directory, and execute the command
	./bootstrap
This command will call the various autoconf/automake etc. tools in the
correct order to build a configure script.  Then decide where you want
to build the tool (it can be in the directory itself, but also in some
other directory), change to that location and call configure from the
source directory.  Finally, run "make" and "make install".

The tool directories all have a file README with instructions for that
tool.
