* Wed May  6 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- There was a problem with the MonetDB SELinux support on Fedora 32.
  That is fixed in this release.  In order to do a proper upgrade of
  the package if you have already installed MonetDB-selinux on Fedora
  32, you may need to uninstall (dnf remove) the old package and then
  install the new.

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.33.1-20190405
- There is one tunable parameter, mserver5_can_read_home, which can
  be set using "setsebool -P mserver5_can_read_home=true" to allow an
  mserver5 process started by monetdbd under the control of systemd to
  read files in users' home directories.
