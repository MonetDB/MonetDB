Pathfinder XQuery Compiler ($Revision$, $Date$)
(c) Database Group, Technische Universitaet Muenchen

Usage: pf [OPTION] [FILE]

  Reads from standard input if FILE is omitted.

  -A, --mil: generate MIL code
  -M, --mil_2004: generate MIL code (directly from XQuery Core) (default)
  -S, --sql: generate SQL code

  -I, --xml-import: import logical-algebra-plan from xml file

  -D, --dot: print internal tree structure in AT&T dot notation
  -P, --text: print internal tree structure in human-readable notation
              (can be used in combination with options -a or -c)
  -X, --xml: print internal algebraic plan in XML notation
             (if options -A, -M, and -S are not used this option
              implicitly extends options with -S, -l, and -s18)

  -a, --abstract-syntax-tree: enable generation of abstract syntax tree
  -c, --core-tree: enable generation of internal Core language
  -t, --typing: enable generation of static types in internal Core language
                using {...} (can be used in combination with option -c)
  -l, --logical-algebra-plan: enable generation of logical algebra plan
  -p, --physical-algebra-plan: enable generation of physical algebra plan
  -f<format>, --format=<format>: enable generation of algebra properties
         +  print all available properties (logical/physical algebra)
         c  print cost value (physical algebra)
         o  print orderings (physical algebra)

  -s<phase>, --stop-after=<phase>: stop processing after certain phase:
         1  right after input parsing
         2  after loading XQuery modules
         3  after parse/abstract syntax tree has been normalized
         4  after namespaces have been checked and resolved
         5  after option declarations have been extracted from the parse tree
         6  after guide tree has been build
         7  after variable scoping has been checked
         8  after XQuery built-in functions have been loaded
         9  after valid function usage has been checked
        10  after XML Schema predefined types have been loaded
        11  after XML Schema document has been imported (if any)
        12  after the abstract syntax tree has been mapped to Core
        13  after the Core tree has been simplified/normalized
        14  after type inference and checking
        15  after XQuery Core optimization
        16  after the Core tree has been translated to the logical algebra
        17  after the logical algebra tree has been rewritten/optimized
        18  after the CSE on the logical algebra tree
        19  after compiling logical algebra into the physical algebra (or SQL)
        20  after introducing recursion boundaries
        21  after compiling the physical algebra into MIL code
        22  after the MIL program has been serialized

  -o<options>, --optimize-algebra=<options>: optimize algebra according to options:
         O  apply optimization based on constant property
         I  apply optimization based on icols property
         K  apply optimization based on key property
         D  apply optimization based on domain property
         C  apply optimization using multiple properties (complex)
            (and icols based optimization will be applied afterwards)
         G  apply general optimization (without properties)
         V  apply optimization based on required values property
         [  map column names to unique column names
         J  push down equi-joins (requires unique column names)
         ]  map column names back (from unique names to original names)
         M  apply optimization based on multi-value dependencies
         S  apply optimization based on set property
         }  introduce proxy operators that representoperator groups
         {  remove proxy operators
         P  infer all properties
         _  does nothing (used for structuring the options)
            (default for option -A is: '-o OIKDCG_VGO_[J]OKVCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCGCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCG}IMTS{_[J]OKVCGCG}IMTS{_[J]OKVCG}IMTS{_[J]OKVCGE[]CGP')
            (default for option -S is: '-o OIKDCG_VGO_[J]OKVCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCGCG}IM__{_[J]OKVCG}IMTS{_[J]OKVCGUCG}IMTS{_[J]OKVCGU}IMTS{_[J]OKVCGUE[]CGP}IQ[J]}IQ[J]IOKVCGQUCGP')

  -e[0|1], --mil-dead-code-elimination=[0|1]: dead code elimination (on the MIL level):
         0  disable dead code elimination
         1  enable dead code elimination (default)
  -O[0-3], --optimize: select optimization level (default=1)
                       (only works in combination with option -M)
  -d TEST, --debug=TEST: call internall debugging function TEST
  -b, --enable-standoff: enable StandOff axis steps
  -q, --quiet: do not print informational messages to log file

  -T, --timing: print elapsed times for compiler phases
