         8  after XML Schema predefined types have been loaded
         9  after XML Schema document has been imported (if any)
        10  after the abstract syntax tree has been mapped to Core
        11  after the Core tree has been simplified/normalized
        12  after type inference and checking
        13  after XQuery Core optimization
        14  after the Core tree has been translated to the logical algebra
