# ChangeLog file for MonetDB
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Mon Jul 30 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The macros bunfastapp and tfastins and variants no longer set the dirty
  flag of the heap they write to.  This now needs to be done separately
  (and preferably outside of the inner loop).

* Fri Jul 27 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed batDirty flag from BAT record.  Its function is completely
  superseded by batDirtydesc and the dirty flags on the various heaps.

* Tue Jul 24 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed "masksize" argument of function BAThash.

* Tue May 29 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- A whole bunch of functions that took an int argument that was used as a
  Boolean (true/false) value now take a value of type bool.  The functions
  BATkeyed, BATordered and BATordered_rev now return a bool instead of
  an int.

* Tue Mar 20 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed the tdense property: it's function is completely replaced by
  whether or not tseqbase is equal to oid_nil.
