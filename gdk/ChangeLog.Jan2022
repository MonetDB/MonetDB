# ChangeLog file for GDK

- Many (most) low level functions that could take a long time (such as
  BATjoin) can now be aborted with a timeout.  When the function takes too
  long, the function will fail, and hence the whole SQL query will fail.
- At some point in the past, string heaps were created where the
  hash value of the string was stored in the heap before the string.
  This hasn't been used in a long time.  Now the code that could still
  read those old heaps has been removed.  Bats that used the old format
  are converted automatically.

- Some small interface changes to the atom functions: the atomPut function
  now returns (var_t) -1 on error instead of 0; the atomHeap function
  now returns success or failure as a gdk_return value.
