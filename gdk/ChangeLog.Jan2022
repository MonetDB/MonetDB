- Fixed a bug in the append code for msk (bit mask) bats.
- Conversions from floating point types to integral types that involve
  multiplication now use the "long double" as intermediate type, thereby
  loosing as few significant bits as is feasible.
- Found and fixed another source for the now infamous BBPcheckbats error
  that sometimes occurs at startup of the server.
