- Implement string imprints (strimps for short) a pre-filter structure
  for strings in order to accelerate LIKE queries. If a strimp exists
  for a specific string column the strings are pre-filtered, rejecting
  strings that cannot possibly match, before the more expensive and
  accurate matching algorithms run.
