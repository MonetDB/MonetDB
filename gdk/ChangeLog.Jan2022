* Mon Sep 19 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed a bug in ORDER BY with both NULLS LAST and LIMIT when the ordering
  was on an interger or integer-like column and NULL values are present.

* Wed Aug 24 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The median_avg and quantile_avg returned bogus results in the
  non-grouped case (i.e. something like SELECT sys.median_avg(i) FROM t).
