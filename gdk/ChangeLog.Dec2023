- Removed the compiled-in limit on the number of threads that can be used.
  The number of threads are still limited, but the limit is dictated
  solely by the operating system and the availability of enough memory.

- We now prevent accidental upgrades from a database without 128 bit
  integers to one with 128 bit integers (also known as HUGEINT) from
  happening.  Upgrades will only be done if the server is started with
  the option --set allow_hge_upgrade=yes.
