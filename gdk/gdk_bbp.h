/* These 4 symbols indicate what the persistence state is of a bat.
 * - If the bat was persistent at the last commit (or at startup
 *   before the first commit), BBPEXISTING or BBPDELETED is set.
 * - If the bat is to be persistent after the next commit, BBPEXISTING
 *   or BBPNEW is set (i.e. (status&BBPPERSISTENT) != 0).
 * - If the bat was transient at the last commit (or didn't exist),
 *   BBPNEW is set, or none of these flag values is set.
 * - If the bat is to be transient at the next commit, BBPDELETED is
 *   set, or none of these flag values is set.
 * BATmode() switches between BBPDELETED and BBPEXISTING (bat was
 * persistent at last commit), or between BBPNEW and 0 (bat was
 * transient or didn't exist at last commit).
 * Committing a bat switches from BBPNEW to BBPEXISTING, or turns off
 * BBPDELETED.
 * In any case, only at most one of BBPDELETED, BBPEXISTING, and
 * BBPNEW may be set at any one time.
 *
 * In short,
 * BBPEXISTING -- bat was and should remain persistent;
 * BBPDELETED -- bat was persistent at last commit and should be transient;
 * BBPNEW -- bat was transient at last commit and should be persistent;
 * none of the above -- bat was and should remain transient.
