- A bug that would very occasionally produce an error "strPut: incorrectly
  encoded UTF-8", even when no incorrectly coded characters are used
  at all, has been fixed.  It was the result of a rare combination of
  strings having been added to the column that caused essentially an
  off-by-one type of error to occur.
