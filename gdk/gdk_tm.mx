@* Transaction management
The Transaction Manager maintains the buffer of (permanent) BATS held resident.
Entries from the BAT buffer are always accessed by BAT id.
A BAT becomes permanent by assigning a name with @%BATrename@.
Access to the transaction table is regulated by a semaphore.

@- 
The physical (disk) commit protocol is handled mostly by BBPsync. Once a commit
succeeded, there is the task of removing ex-persistent bats (those that still
were persistent in the previous commit, but were made transient in this transaction).
Notice that such ex- (i.e. non-) persistent bats are not backed up by the BBPsync
protocol, so we cannot start deleting after we know the commit will succeed.

Another hairy issue are the delta statuses in BATs. These provide a fast way
to perform a transaction abort (HOT-abort, instead of COLD-abort, which is achieved
by the BBP recovery in a database restart). Hot-abort functionality has not been 
important in MonetDB for now, so it is not well-tested. The problem here is that 
if a commit fails in the physical part (BBPsync), we have not sufficient information 
to roll back the delta statuses. 

So a 'feature' of the abort is that after a failed commit, in-memory we
*will* commit the transaction. Subsequent commits can retry to achieve a physical
commit. The only way to abort in such a situation is COLD-abort: quit the server and 
restart, so you get the recovered disk images.

@- TMcommit
global commit without any multi-threaded access assumptions, thus taking all BBP locks. 
It creates a new database checkpoint.
@c
int
TMcommit(void)
{
	int ret = -1;

	/* commit with the BBP globally locked */
	BBPlock("TMcommit");
	if (prelude(BBPsize, NULL) == 0 && BBPsync(BBPsize, NULL) == 0) {
		ret = epilogue(BBPsize, NULL);
	}
	BBPunlock("TMcommit");
	return ret;
}

@- TMsubcommit

Create a new checkpoint that is equal to the previous, with the expection that
for the passed list of batnames, the current state will be reflected in the 
new checkpoint.

On the bats in this list we assume exclusive access during the operation.

This operation is useful for e.g. adding a new XQuery document or SQL
table to the committed state (after bulk-load). Or for dropping a table or doc,
without forcing the total database to be clean, which may require a lot of I/O.

We expect the globally locked phase (BBPsync) to take little time (<100ms)
as only the BBP.dir is written out; and for the existing bats that were
modified, only some heap moves are done (moved from BAKDIR to SUBDIR).
The atomic commit for sub-commit is the rename of SUBDIR to DELDIR.

As it does not take the BBP-locks (thanks to the assumption that access
is exclusive), the concurrency impact of subcommit is also much lighter to 
ongoing concurrent query and update facilities than a real global TMcommit.
@c
int
TMsubcommit_list(bat *subcommit, int cnt)
{
	int xx, ret = -1;

	assert(cnt > 0);
	assert(subcommit[0] == 0); /* BBP artifact: slot 0 in the array will be ignored */

	/* sort the list on BAT id */
	GDKqsort(subcommit + 1, NULL, NULL, cnt - 1, sizeof(bat), 0, TYPE_bat);

	assert(cnt == 1 || subcommit[1] > 0);  /* all values > 0 */
	if (prelude(cnt, subcommit) == 0) {	/* save the new bats outside the lock */
		/* lock just prevents BBPtrims, and other global (sub-)commits */
		for (xx = 0; xx <= BBP_THREADMASK; xx++)
			gdk_set_lock(GDKtrimLock(xx), "TMsubcommit");
		if (BBPsync(cnt, subcommit) == 0) {	/* write BBP.dir (++) */
			ret = epilogue(cnt, subcommit);

	BUN p, q;
	BATiter bi = bat_iterator(b);

	subcommit[0] = 0;	/* BBP artifact: slot 0 in the array will be ignored */

@- TMabort
Transaction abort is cheap. We use the delta statuses
to go back to the previous version of each BAT. Also
for BATs that are currently swapped out. Persistent BATs 
that were made transient in this transaction become
persistent again.
@c
int
TMabort(void)
{
	int i;

	BBPlock("TMabort");

			BAT *b = BBPquickdesc(i, FALSE);

			if (b) {
				if (b->batPersistence == PERSISTENT)
					BBPdecref(i, TRUE);
				b->batPersistence = TRANSIENT;
				b->batDirtydesc = 1;
			}
		}
	}
	for (i = 1; i < BBPsize; i++) {
		if (BBP_status(i) & (BBPPERSISTENT | BBPDELETED | BBPSWAPPED)) {
			BAT *b = BBPquickdesc(i, TRUE);

			if (b == NULL)
				continue;

			BBPfix(i);
			if (BATdirty(b) || DELTAdirty(b)) {
				/* BUN move-backes need a real BAT! */
				/* Stefan: 
				 * Actually, in case DELTAdirty(b), i.e., a
				 * BAT with differences that is
				 * saved/swapped-out but not yet committed,
				 * we (AFAIK) don't have to load the BAT and
				 * apply the undo, but rather could simply
				 * discard the delta and revive the backup;
				 * however, I don't know how to do this
				 * (yet), hence we stick with this solution
				 * for the time being --- it should be
				 * correct though it might not be the most
				 * efficient way...
				 */
				b = BBPdescriptor(i);
				BATundo(b);
			}
			if (BBP_status(i) & BBPDELETED) {
				BBP_status_on(i, BBPEXISTING, "TMabort");
				if (b->batPersistence != PERSISTENT)
					BBPincref(i, TRUE);
				b->batPersistence = PERSISTENT;
				b->batDirtydesc = 1;
			}
			BBPunfix(i);
		}
		BBP_status_off(i, BBPDELETED | BBPSWAPPED | BBPNEW, "TMabort");
	}
	BBPunlock("TMabort");
