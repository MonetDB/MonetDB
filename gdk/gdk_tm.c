 * BAT id.  A BAT becomes permanent by assigning a name with
 * @%BBPrename@.  Access to the transaction table is regulated by a

/*
 * The physical (disk) commit protocol is handled mostly by
 * BBPsync. Once a commit succeeded, there is the task of removing
 * ex-persistent bats (those that still were persistent in the
 * previous commit, but were made transient in this transaction).
 * Notice that such ex- (i.e. non-) persistent bats are not backed up
 * by the BBPsync protocol, so we cannot start deleting after we know
 * the commit will succeed.
 *
 * Another hairy issue are the delta statuses in BATs. These provide a
 * fast way to perform a transaction abort (HOT-abort, instead of
 * COLD-abort, which is achieved by the BBP recovery in a database
 * restart). Hot-abort functionality has not been important in MonetDB
 * for now, so it is not well-tested. The problem here is that if a
 * commit fails in the physical part (BBPsync), we have not sufficient
 * information to roll back the delta statuses.
 *
 * So a 'feature' of the abort is that after a failed commit,
 * in-memory we *will* commit the transaction. Subsequent commits can
 * retry to achieve a physical commit. The only way to abort in such a
 * situation is COLD-abort: quit the server and restart, so you get
 * the recovered disk images.
