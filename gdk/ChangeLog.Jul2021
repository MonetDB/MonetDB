- When appending to a string bat, we made an optimization where the string
  heap was sometimes copied completely to avoid having to insert strings
  individually.  This copying was still done too eagerly, so now the
  string heap is copied less frequently.  In particular, when appending
  to an empty bat, the string heap is now not always copied whole.
