# This file contains past ChangeLog entries

* Tue Mar 22 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110324
- Fixed memory detection on Darwin (Mac OS X) systems not to return
  bogus values

* Fri Jan 14 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- MonetDB/src/gdk was moved to gdk

* Fri Aug 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fixed a bug where some internal reference counting was done incorrectly,
  causing an infinite loop when exiting the server due to it being killed.
  This bug probably only manifested itself in MonetDB/XQuery.  Bug 2658.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Thu Apr 15 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when string BATs are combined.
  (SF bug 2947763.)

* Sun Apr 11 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fixed a potential file leak: under certain conditions, files in the
  database might not get deleted when they should (they would be
  deleted when the server restarts).

* Mon Mar 29 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fix regression introduced in Feb2010-SP1 causing UDP connections to
  malfunction, in particular affecting the stethoscope tool.

* Mon Mar 01 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.3-20100322
- Fixed bug in UDP stream creation causing UDP connections to already
  bound ports to be reported as successful.

* Mon Feb 22 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Various concurrency bugs were fixed.
- Various changes were made to run better on systems that don't have
  enough memory to keep everything in core that was touched during
  query processing.  This is done by having the higher layers giving
  hints to the database kernel about future use, and the database
  kernel giving hints to the operating system kernel about how
  (virtual) memory is going to be used.

* Thu Feb 18 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed bug in mergejoin implementation.  This fixes bug #2952191.

* Tue Feb  2 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Added support for compiling on Windows using the Cygwin-provided
  version of flex.

* Thu Jan 21 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fix compilation issue when configured with --with-curl.  This fixes
  bug #2924999.

* Thu Jan 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Added implementation of MT_getrss() for Solaris.  This yields in the
  kernel knowing about its (approximate) memory usage to try and help
  the operating system to free that memory that is best to free,
  instead of a random page, e.g. the work of the vmtrim thread.

* Wed Jan 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Implemented a "fast" string BAT append: Under certain conditions,
  instead of inserting values one-by-one, we now concatenate the
  string heap wholesale and just manipulate the offsets.  This works
  both for BATins and BATappend.

* Wed Jan  6 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Changed the string heap implementation to also contain the hashes of
  strings.
- Changed the implementation of the string offset columns to be
  dynamically sized.
