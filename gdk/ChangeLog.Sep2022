# ChangeLog file for GDK
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- When saving a bat failed for some reason during a low-level commit,
  this was logged in the log file, but the error was then subsequently
  ignored, possibly leading to files that are too short or even missing.
- The write-ahead log (WAL) is now rotated a bit more efficiently by
  doing multiple log files in one go (i.e. in one low-level transaction).
