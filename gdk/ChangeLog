# ChangeLog file for MonetDB
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Tue Nov  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The NIL representation of the internal flt and dbl types was changed
  from the smallest representable finite value to NaN (not-a-number).

* Mon Sep 18 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Changed the interface of ATOMformat and VALformat: they now return a
  pointer to the allocated string.

* Thu Sep 14 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The length "method" for atoms now returns a size_t, the "len" field of
  a ValRecord is now a size_t, the "size" field of the atomDesc structure
  is now unsigned short.
- Removed the "align" field from the ATOM descriptor (atomDesc) structure.
- The atomtostr and atomfromstr "methods" for atoms now return ssize_t
  and require a pointer to size_t for the size of the buffer.
- The atom tostr and fromstr "methods" now always return -1 on error.
  A return value greater than 0 is normal, a return value of 0 is not
  normal, but technically not an error.
