- Implemented function BUNreplacemultiincr to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, starting at a given position.
- Implemented new function BUNreplacemulti to replace multiple values
  in a BAT in one go, at the given positions.
- Removed function BUNinplace, just use BUNreplace, and check whether
  the BAT argument is of type TYPE_void before calling if you don't
  want to materialize.

* Mon Mar 15 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Implemented a function BUNappendmulti which appends an array of values
  to a BAT.  It is a generalization of the function BUNappend.

* Thu Feb 25 2021 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Changed the interface of the atom read function.  It now requires an
  extra pointer to a size_t value that gives the current size of the
  destination buffer, and when that buffer is too small, it receives the
  size of the reallocated buffer that is large enough.  In any case,
  and as before, the return value is a pointer to the destination buffer.

- Environment variables (sys.env()) must be UTF-8, but since they can
  contain file names which may not be UTF-8, there is now a mechanism
  to store the original values outside of sys.env() and store
  %-escaped (similar to URL escaping) values in the environment.  The
  key must still be UTF-8.

* Tue Dec  1 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- We now save the location of the min and max values when known.
