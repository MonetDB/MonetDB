- Removed macro BBP_cache and its associated code.  Checking whether a
  BAT is cached (loaded in memory) can be done by checking the BBPLOADED
  bit in the BBP_status value.  Getting a pointer to the BAT descriptor
  can be done by using BBP_desc.

- The SQL transaction ID is no longer saved in the BBP.dir file.

* Wed Jan  3 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Made some changes to the TIMEOUT macros.  Most importantly, they
  now get a pointer to a QryCtx structure as argument instead of the
  timeout value.
