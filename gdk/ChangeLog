* Tue Dec  3 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed the tunique property.  The tunique property indicated that
  all values in the column had to be distinct.  It was removed because
  it wasn't used.

* Fri Nov 22 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- BATrangeselect now has two extra arguments: anti and symmetric
  (both bool).
