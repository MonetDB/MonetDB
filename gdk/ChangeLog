# ChangeLog file for GDK

- Environment variables (sys.env()) must be UTF-8, but since they can
  contain file names which may not be UTF-8, there is now a mechanism
  to store the original values outside of sys.env() and store
  %-escaped (similar to URL escaping) values in the environment.  The
  key must still be UTF-8.

* Tue Dec  1 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- We now save the location of the min and max values when known.
