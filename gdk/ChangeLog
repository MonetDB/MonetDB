# ChangeLog file for MonetDB

* Tue May 29 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- A whole bunch of functions that took an int argument that was used as a
  Boolean (true/false) value now take a value of type bool.  The functions
  BATkeyed, BATordered and BATordered_rev now return a bool instead of
  an int.

* Tue Mar 20 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed the tdense property: it's function is completely replaced by
  whether or not tseqbase is equal to oid_nil.
