# ChangeLog file for GDK

- log_tflush function, when flushnow flag is true, now passes bitmap array
  that indicates which bat id's need to be sync'ed to disk, instead
  of passing NULL which would trigger a sync of the full catalog. If
  new bats are added to the catalog, they will be sync'ed always (see
  maxupdated flag).
