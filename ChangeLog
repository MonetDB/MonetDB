- It is now possible to specify an idle timeout using --set
  idle_timeout=<seconds> (see mserver5 manual page) which gets triggered
  if a connection to the server is idle (i.e. does not send any queries
  to the server) while there is a SQL transaction active.

- Changed the way complex AND and OR expressions are handled. The new
  expression tree uses 2 new cmp flag (cmp_con/cmp_dis), both expressions
  hold lists of expressions. This structure reduces the need for stack
  space, allowing way larger expressions trees to be handled.
