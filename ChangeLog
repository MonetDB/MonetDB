# ChangeLog file for devel
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri Dec  6 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added mserver5 option (--set raw_strings=true|false) and monetdb
  database property (raw_strings=yes|no) to control interpretation
  of strings.

* Fri Nov 29 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added support for raw strings using the syntax r'' or R''. This means
  that C-like escapes will remain uninterpreted within those strings. For
  instance SELECT r'\"' returns a string of length two. The user needs
  to escape single quotes by doubling them: SELECT r''''.

* Fri Oct 25 2019 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added SQL function sys.hot_snapshot() which can be used to write
  a snapshot of the database to a tar file. For example,
  sys.hot_snapshot('/tmp/snapshot.tar'). If compression support is
  compiled in, snapshots can also be compressed ('/tmp/snapshot.tar.gz').
  The tar file expands to a single directory with the same name as the
  database that was snapshotted. This directory can be passed directly
  as the --dbpath argument of mserver5 or it can be copied into an
  existing dbfarm and started from monetdbd.

* Sat Oct 12 2019 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl>
- The MAL profiler now assigns the SQL TRACE output to the client record
  thereby avoiding the interaction with other queries, but loosing
  insight of competing queries. The stethoscope should be used for that.
