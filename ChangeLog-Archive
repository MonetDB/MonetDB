* Tue Mar 11 2025 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.53.1-20250317
- There is a new shared library called libmutils that contains some
  utility functions that are used by several programs.

* Mon Sep 16 2024 Joeri van Ruth <joeri.van.ruth@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.53.1-20250317
- Hot snapshot: allow member files larger than 64 GiB. By member files we mean
  the files inside the resulting .tar file, not the tar file itself. Huge member
  files are written using a GNU tar extension to the original tar format, which
  doesn't support more than 8 GiB.

* Tue Aug  6 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- The CMake configuration files for building extensions have now been
  included in the various MonetDB development RPMs and debs.

* Tue Jun 25 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- Removed upgrade code for versions before Jul2021.

* Wed May  8 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.51.1-20240812
- The shared library (.dll aka .so files) now have the version number
  as part of the name.  This should allow the building of compatibility
  versions that can be installed in parallel to the latest version.
- Some of the Debian/Ubuntu packages have been renamed.  The old monetdb5
  names have been changed to plain monetdb, and libmonetdb5-server-*
  packages have been renamed monetdb-*.
- The names of some of the provided RPM files have been changed.
  References to the old MonetDB5 name have been removed.  All packages
  are now just MonetDB.

* Thu Jan 11 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.3-20240304
- The copyright for the MonetDB software has been transferred to the newly
  established MonetDB Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation with the
  express goal of furthering the MonetDB database system.  The license
  for the software does not change: MonetDB remains fully open source.

* Fri Dec  1 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- All binary packages are now signed with a new key with key fingerprint
  DBCE 5625 94D7 1959 7B54  CE85 3F1A D47F 5521 A603.

* Mon Oct 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.49.1-20231221
- The ranges of merge partitions are now pushed down into the low
  level GDK operations, giving them a handle to sometimes execute more
  efficiently.

* Thu Jul 27 2023 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.49.1-20231221
- Removed the PYTHON MAP external language option, as after a fork the
  synchronization primitives could be in any state, leading to deadlocks.
  During the upgrade function definitions will fallback to the normal
  PYTHON language option.

* Mon Jul 17 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.49.1-20231221
- Implemented direct masking for strimp construction. The strimps
  datastructure now keeps an array of 65K 64-bit integers that is zero
  everywhere except at the indexes that correspond to header pairs. The
  entry for the nth pair in order has the nth bit of the bitstring
  on. These can be used to quickly construct bitstrings.

* Fri Sep 29 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.11-20230929
- Fixed an installation issue on Debian and Ubuntu introduced in the
  last build.

* Wed Aug 30 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.47.7-20230925
- Do a lot more error checking, mostly for allocation failures.  More is
  still needed, though.

* Thu Aug 10 2023 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.47.7-20230925
- Improve performance of the ILIKE operator when the pattern contains only
  ASCII characters. In this case we do not need to treat any characters as
  UTF-8 and we can use much faster routines that perform byte comparisons.

* Wed Jan 12 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.43.5-20220118
- A couple of concurrency issues have been fixed.

* Mon Aug 10 2020 Ying Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- Finished a first version of the new monitoring function
  user_statistics(), which is only intended for the DBAs.
  For each database user who has logged in during the current mserver5
  session, it returns
  "username": login name of the database user,
  "querycount": the number of queries this user has executed since his/her
      first login,
  "totalticks": the total execution time (in microsecond) of the queries ran
      by this user,
  "maxquery": the query with the longest execution time (if two queries have
      the same execution time, the newer overwrites the older),
  "maxticks": the execution time of the 'maxquery' (in microsecond),
  "started": the start timestamp of the 'maxquery',
  "finished": the finish timestamp of the 'maxquery'.

* Wed Jun 10 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.39.1-20201006
- Removed support for LiDAR data, that is the SQL procedures
  sys.lidarattach, sys.lidarload, and sys.lidarexport.

* Thu Apr  2 2020 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl> - 11.39.1-20201006
- The sys.queue() has been turned into a circular buffer to allow for
  inspection of both active, paused and recently executed queries.

* Mon Apr 20 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- A new system to deal with debug output has been implemented.  There is
  now an option --dbtrace to mserver5 that takes a file argument to which
  debug output is written.  The default value is the file mdbtrace.log
  inside the database directory.  This option can also be set through
  the monetdb program.
- The home directory of the automatically created monetdb user was
  changed from /var/MonetDB to /var/lib/monetdb (RPM based systems
  only).  This home directory is (currently) not used for anything,
  though.
- Python 2 support has been removed.  There is now only support for
  using Python 3.

* Thu Jan 30 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.37.1-20200511
- Removed support for bam and sam files.

* Fri Dec  6 2019 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.37.1-20200511
- Added mserver5 option (--set raw_strings=true|false) and monetdb
  database property (raw_strings=yes|no) to control interpretation
  of strings.

* Wed Oct 10 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.31.11-20181011
- Some subtle dependencies between RPMs have been fixed.

* Wed Feb 14 2018 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 11.29.1-20180315
- mclient's execution time profiling options and output format have
  been changed. Instead of implicitly via the "--interactive"/"-i"
  option (or when using an interactive mclient console), execution time
  profiling is now controlled via an explicit "--timer=timermode"/"-t
  timermode" command-line option, or a "\t timermode" command in the
  interactive mclient console. The default (also in the interactive
  mclient console) is now timermode "none", i.e., no timing information
  is given. Timermode "clock" activates client-side wall-clock timing
  ("clk") in "human-friendly" format much like the interactive mode did
  before. Timermode "performance" also provides detailed server-side
  timings: "sql" is the time to parse the SQL query, optimize the
  logical relational plan and create the initial physical (MAL) plan;
  "opt" is the time to optimize the physical (MAL) plan; "run" is the
  time to execute the physical (MAL) plan. With timermode "performance"
  all server-side timings and the client-side wall-clock time are given
  in milliseconds (ms). Note that the client-measured wall-clock time
  "clk" is reported per query only when options "--interactive" or
  "--echo" are used, because only then does mclient send individual
  lines (statements) of the SQL script to the server. Otherwise, mclient
  sends the SQL script in large(r) batch(es) to the server, and, thus,
  only the total wall-clock time per batch is measured and reported. The
  server-measured detailed performance timings "sql", "opt", "run" are
  always measured and reported per query. Also, all timing information
  is now given on a separate line and sent to stderr rather than stdout.

* Fri Feb  9 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.29.1-20180315
- Some types and constants were moved from configure (and hence
  monetdb_config.h) to gdk.h.  In particular, the types "lng" and
  "ulng" have been moved and can therefore no longer be used by code
  that doesn't (ultimately) include gdk.h.  Just use int64_t instead.
  A bunch of format defines have been removed: SZFMT, SSZFMT, PTRFMT,
  PDFMT.  Just use the C standard codes for those (%zu, %zd, %p, %td).
  The define for printing a lng (LLFMT) was also moved.  Use PRId64 for
  printing int64_t in code not using gdk.h.  Removed all references to
  __int64 and long long (use int64_t instead).

* Thu Apr 13 2017 Mark Raasveldt <m.raasveldt@cwi.nl> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Added a new server-side protocol implementation. The new protocol
  is backwards compatible with the old protocol. Clients can choose
  whether they want to use the old or the new protocol during the initial
  handshake with the server. The new protocol is a binary column-based
  protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when
  transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports
  compression using Snappy or LZ4.

* Mon Feb 20 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Moved the sphinx extension module to its own repository.
  See https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-sphinx/.

* Thu Feb 16 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Removed GSL module: it's now a separate (extension) package.
  See https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-gsl/.
- The PCRE library is now optional for systems that support POSIX regular
  expressions.

* Thu Jan 12 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com> - 11.27.1-20170705
- Added 5 new sys schema tables: function_languages, function_types,
  key_types, index_types and privilege_codes.  They are pre-loaded with
  static content and contain descriptive names for the various integer
  type and code values.  See also sql/scripts/51_sys_schema_extension.sql

* Thu Sep 22 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.25.1-20161214
- The Perl, PHP, and Python clients, and the JDBC driver each now have
  their own repositories and release cycles.  The Python client is
  maintained by Gijs Molenaar on Github
  (https://github.com/gijzelaerr/pymonetdb), the other clients are
  maintained by CWI/MonetDB on our own server
  (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-java,
  https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-perl,
  https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-php).

* Fri Jul  1 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.23.5-20160704
- Lots of memory leaks have been plugged across the whole system.
