# ChangeLog file for devel
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed May  8 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The shared library (.dll aka .so files) now have the version number
  as part of the name.  This should allow the building of compatibility
  versions that can be installed in parallel to the latest version.
- Some of the Debian/Ubuntu packages have been renamed.  The old monetdb5
  names have been changed to plain monetdb, and libmonetdb5-server-*
  packages have been renamed monetdb-*.
- The names of some of the provided RPM files have been changed.
  References to the old MonetDB5 name have been removed.  All packages
  are now just MonetDB.
