- Changed generic Decimal handling (ie without digits/scale), old cased
  mapped always into dec(18,3) now this is only done in case of create of
  a column. In other cases the coercion to the correct decimal type is
  based on the input data type. For *api (LANG*PY/C(pp)/R) we no longer
  allow generic decimal type in the function definitions.
