# Test SQL API for TRACER:
# In some test cases (marked with #WARNING) the argument used is supposed to be 
# an enum entry used to count the number of elements (e.g: COMPONENTS_COUNT in 
# gdk_tracer.h). Thus, in those cases an error should be raised. However, adding 
# new entries to the enum will affect the marked test cases and they won't fail.
