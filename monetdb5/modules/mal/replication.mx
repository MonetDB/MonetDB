@+ Database replication
MonetDB supports a simple database replication scheme using a master-slave
protocol. A master node keeps a log of all SQL updates for replay.
Once a slave starts the master establishes
a MAL-client connection to the slave and starts pumping the backlog
of committed transactions.
The master does not take any responsibility over the integrity of a slave.
The master may, however, decide to suspend
forwarding updates to prepare for e.g. administration or shutdown.

It is the slave's responsibility to be resilient against duplicate 
transmission of the MAL-update backlog. A transaction id
can be given to catch up from transactions already replayed.
Transaction ideas before the minimum available in the log
directory leads to freezing the slave. Then rebuilding from
scratch is required.

The replication scheme does not support SQL scheme modifications.
Instead, the slaves should be initialized with a complete copy
of the master schema and the database.

Turning an existing database into a master and creation of a single
slave works as follows.

step 1) Turn the database into a replication master by setting its
"master" property to true using monetdb(1).  This property is translated
by merovingian(1) into the database variable "replication_master" and is
set upon database (re)start.  Note that this setting can not be added to a
running database.

step 2) Create a dump of the master database using the msqldump(1) tool.  

step 3) To initiate a slave, simply load the master snapshot.

step 4) Run monetdb(1) to turn the database into a slave by setting its "slave" property to the URI of the master. 
The precise URI can be obtained issuing the command
'mclient -lmal -dmaster -s"u := master.getURI(); io.printf(\"%s\n\", u);"' on the master.
The slave property is translated by merovingian(1) into the database variable "replication_slave" 
and is set upon database (re)start.  Note that this setting can not be added to a running database. 

The slave starts synchronizing with the master automatically upon each session restart.
A few SQL wrapper procedures and functions can be used to control it manually.
For example, the slave can temporarily suspend receiving log replays using suspendSync()
and reactive it afterwards with resumeSync().
A resumeSync() is also needed if you create a relation already known by the master,
for it could have sent updates already. Due to unavailability of the target
table it closed the log stream.

The function freezeSlaves() removes the log files and makes sure that all
existing slaves won't be able to catch up other then by re-initializing the
database using e.g. a checkpoint.
@verbatim
CREATE PROCEDURE suspendSync() EXTERNAL NAME slave."stop";
CREATE PROCEDURE resumeSync() EXTERNAL NAME slave."sync";
CREATE FUNCTION synchronizing() RETURNS boolean EXTERNAL NAME slave."synchronizing";

CREATE PROCEDURE freezeSlaves() EXTERNAL NAME master."freeze";
CREATE PROCEDURE suspendSlaves() EXTERNAL NAME master."stop";
CREATE PROCEDURE resumeSlaves() EXTERNAL NAME master."start";
CREATE FUNCTION master() RETURNS string EXTERNAL NAME master."getURI";
CREATE FUNCTION cutOffTag() RETURNS string EXTERNAL NAME master."getCutOffTag";
@end verbatim

It is possible to make a slave database also a master for descendants.
In such situation the database carries both a master and slave property.
Creating such scheme allows to employ hierarchical replication, or to
have additional tables available in the replication stream.  Note that
at this point replication from multiple masters to e.g. combine a full
set from a set of partitioned masters is not yet possible.

Beware, turning off the "master" property leads to automatic removal of all
left-over log files.  This renders the master database unusable for replication.
The state of the slaves becomes frozen.
To restore replication in such case, both master and
slaves have to be reinitialised using the aforementioned steps.

@- Behind the scene
When the replication_master environment is set, an optimizer
becomes active to look after updates on SQL tables and to prepare
for producing the log files. The snippet below illustrates the
modifications made to a query plan.

@verbatim
function query():void
  master:= "mapi:monetdb://gio.ins.cwi.nl:50000/dbmaster";
  fcnid:= master.open();
  ...
  sql.append("schema","table","col",b:[:oid,:int]);
  master.append("schema","table","col",b,fcnid);
  ...
  t := mtime.current_timestamp();
  master.close(fcnid,t);
end query;
@end verbatim

At runtime this leads to buffers being filled with the statements
required for the slaves to catch up. 
Each query block is stored in its own buffer and sent at
the end of the query block. This separates the concurrent 
actions on the database at the master and leads to a serial
execution of the replication operations within the slave.

The log records are stored in a file "dbfarm/db/master/log%d-%d" with the 
following structure:
@verbatim
function slave.tag1(transactionid:int,stamp:timestamp);
  barrier doit:= slave.open(transactionid);
    sql.transaction();
    tag1_b := bat.new(:oid,:int);
    ...
    bat.insert(tag1_b,3:oid,232:int); #example update
    ...
    sql.append("schema","table","col",tag1_b,tag);
    slave.close(transactionid,stamp);
    sql.commit();
  exit doit;
end tag1;
slave.tag_1(1,"2009-09-03 15:49:45.000":timestamp);
slave.drop("tag1");
@end verbatim

The slave.open() simply checks the replica log administration table
and ignores duplicate attempts to roll the database forward.

The operations are executed in the serial order as on the master,
which should lead to the same optimistic transactional behavior.
All queries are considered running in auto-commit mode, because
the SQL frontend does not provide the hook (yet) for better transaction
boundary control.
The transaction identifier is part of the call to the function
with the transaction update details.
@- Interaction protocol
The master node simply waits for a slave to request the transmission of the missing log files.
The request includes the URI of the slave and the user credentials needed to establish a connection.
The last parameter is the last known transaction id successfully re-executed.
The master forks a thread to start flushing the blacklog files.

Grouping the operations in temporary MAL functions
makes it easy to skip its execution when we detect
that it has been executed before. 

@- Log file management
The log records are grouped into separate files. 
They are the units for re-submission and the scheme is set up to be idempotent. 
A slave always starts synchronizing using the maximal tag stored in the slave log.

The log files ultimately pollute your database and have to
be (re)moved. This is considered a responsibility for the DBA,
for it involves making a checkpoint or securely storing the logs
into an archive. It can be automated by asking all slaves
for their last transaction id and purge all obsolete files.

Any error recognized during the replay should freeze the slave,
because the synchronization integrity might become compromised.

Aside  from being limited to autocommit transactions, the current
implementation scheme has a hole. The log record is written just
before transaction commit, including the activation call.
The call and the flush of the commit record to the SQL
log should be one atomic action, which amounts to a commit
sequence of two 'databases'. It can only be handled when
the SQL commit becomes visible at the MAL layer.
[ Or, inject the transaction approval record into the log file
when the next query starts, checking for any transaction
errors first.]

COPY INTO commands cause the master to freeze the images of
all slaves. For capturing the input file and forwarding it to
the slaves seems overly complicated.

The slaves invalidation scheme is rather crude. The log directory
is emptied and a new log file is created. Subsequent attempts
by the slaves to access transactions ID before the invalidation
are flagged as errors.

@- Wishlist
After setting the slave property, it could initiate full synchronization
by asking for a catalog dump and replaying the logs. Provided, they
have been kept around since the start.
Alternatively, we can use the infrastructure for Octopus to pull the data from the master.
For both we need msqldump functionality in the SQL code base.

A slave property can be set to a list of masters, which turns the
the slave into a serving multiple sources. It calls for splitting
the slavelog.

The tables in the slave should be set read-only, otherwise we
have to double check integrity and bail out replication on violation.
One solution is to store the replicated database in its own
schema and grant read access to all users.
[show example how to set up ]

A validation script (or database diff) might be helpful to
asses the database content for possible integrity violations.
