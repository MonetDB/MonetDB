# MAL Startup file
# Upon starting the Monet/MAL server we need to initialize the symbol table.
# This encompasses loading the signatures of several key modules.
# They are listed below.
#
# Beware, since libraries are loaded dynamically, there is an implicit
# dependency. For example, the mapi module initializer uses the bat module.
# It should be loaded after the bat module.
#
# The negative effect is that this module is inspected as part of
# the function resolution scheme.
#
# The remainder interprets the signatures and resolves the address bindings.
# The signatures may exists without the corresponding function implementation
# to be loaded.  This way, MAL programs can be normally compiled, and only
# upon use of the function will it create the necessary exception.
#
# The order of the includes defines the dependencies.
