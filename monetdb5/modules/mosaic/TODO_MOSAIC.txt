####technical depth####
Add raw to technique overview in analysis
Rename 'capped' and 'var' to 'dict256' and 'dict' respectively.
Make header smaller: add padding to outer struct
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Add negative values to tests
Add test for huge
create mix compression test cases.
benchmark using TPC-H
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Transform control dependency into data dependency select loops.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on constant value in runlength compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select
Timing in the context of MOSanalysis

####code issues####
# Improve macro code style: remove do_ from do_OPERATION-like macro's, NAME -> TECHNIQUE, small caps technique identifier -> CAPITAL CAPS technique identifier.
See if the iteration algorithms can be improved.
Get rid of (most of) MOStask and/or don't allocate it on the heap.
Make sure the parameters.bits fields are always char.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
