####technical depth####
Add lots of tests with candidate lists for all
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
benchmark using TPC-H
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression (1)
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select
Timing in the context of MOSanalysis

####code issues####
See if the iteration algorithms can be improved.
Get rid of (most of) MOStask and/or don't allocate it on the heap.
Make sure the parameters.bits fields are always char.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
Make block headers specific by having type parametrized blockheader struct's.
