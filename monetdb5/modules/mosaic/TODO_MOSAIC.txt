####technical depth####
Finish null semantics plus tests
Add test for join nil_matches set for non-nill tests.
make sure candidate lists are working properly for select, theta_select and join
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Use bit vectors in mosaic_delta --- then resolve test mosaic_delta_timestamp --- and possibly other compression techniques as well.(2)
Remove floating point support in prefix compression and use prefix-like-frame semantics
Apply compressed operations directly on keys in dictionary compression.

consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
delta compression: check if the hardcoded compression expression are correct. (2*)
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.

####code issues####
Update copyright.
create dedicated type for bitvector internal type which is currently unsignned int. E.g. introduce #define BitVectorChunkType unsigned int.
create a common header/source file for mosaic for common tasks e.g. to house a generic IS_NIL macro.
Introduce FrameTpe similar to PrefixTpe.
move mask, bits, framebits from  MosaicHdr to MosaicBlkHeader_frame_t.
mosaic_delta.c: improve the macro's: for instance get rid of hardcoded expression arguments in DELTAcompress. (2)
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions.
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques. (2*)
