####technical depth####
Split the MOSadvance-like functions to type specific variant.
See if compress, decompress and layout can be refactored similar to the algebraic operators.
Factor out boilerplate code mosaic code: resulting mosaic boilerplate is for testing purposes.
Create test for swapped join.
Add lots of tests with candidate lists for all
Add test for float/double
Add test for huge
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression (1)
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression (1)
Be sure alignment is correct. Use asserts for this.
Check MOSanalysis and its test.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
benchmark using TPC-H
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select

####code issues####
Get rid of (most of) MOStask and/or don't allocate it on the heap.
Make sure the parameters.bits fields are always char.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
Make block headers specific by having type parametrized blockheader struct's.
atomic base type of an oid bat is lng. So we can remove that one.
It is a bit cleaner if MOSadvance call's are done outside of select functions.
Refactor frame compressions code to be more inline with the other compression algortihm code.(1)
create a common header/source file for mosaic for common tasks e.g. to house a generic IS_NIL macro, IPtpe, etc.
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions. (1)
Factor out more boilerplate code in various compression techniques. All compression follow similar patterns. (1*)
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques, e.g. MOSskipit skip (2*)
