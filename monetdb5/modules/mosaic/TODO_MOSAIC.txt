####technical depth####
Find mosaic memory-leak
Refactor macro-ised functions to real functions in header files and apply the include trick
benchmark using TPC-H
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.
Add negative values to tests
Add test for huge
create mix compression test cases particularly for dict/dict256 combo.
Introduce a custom pre-processor to expand macro's efficiently for debugging purposes.
Introduce mosaic into gdk: create hooks in scanselect functions/macro's, joins and projections.
make mitosis work with mosaic and see how this relates to the previous landmark stuff.
Transform control dependency into data dependency select loops.
Apply compressed operations more directly: on constant value in runlength compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on keys in dictionary compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on prefix|suffix in prefix compression
Apply compressed operations more directly: on delta's and frame in frame compression
MERGE consecutive estimates where possible for instance for dictionary.
consider packing mosaic_block_header's more efficiently.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
DO nil checking more efficient similar to gdk_select
Timing in the context of MOSanalysis
Add the compression on OID heap for string valued columns too.
Find a more 'generic' model to estimate and explore compression space perhaps Monte Carlo based.
Create a plug-in estimation model framework.

####code issues####
See if the iteration algorithms can be improved.
Use GDK naming conventions, e.g. o for stuff coming out if canditer_next.
