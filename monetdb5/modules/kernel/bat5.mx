@+ Binary Association Tables
This module contains the commands and patterns to manage Binary
Association Tables (BATs). The relational operations you can execute
on BATs have the form of a neat algebra, described in algebra.mx

But a database system needs more that just this algebra, since often it
is crucial to do table-updates (this would not be permitted in a strict
algebra).

All commands needed for BAT updates, property management, basic I/O, 
persistence, and storage options can be found in this module.

All parameters to the modules are passed by reference.
In particular, this means that string values are passed to the module
layer as (str *)
and we have to de-reference them before entering the gdk library.
(Actual a design error in gdk to differentiate passing int/str)
This calls for knowledge on the underlying BAT types`s

@+ BAT properties
Properties of BATs not necessarily require loading the BAT completely.
The BAT identifier can be used to access the descriptors.
These properties can be inspected with the 
@emph{info(BAT[:any_1,:any_2]) :bat[str,str] } command:
@verbatim
> car_age.info.print;
#---------------------------------#
# BAT:               tmp_31       #
# (str)              (str)        #
#---------------------------------#
[ "batId",           "car_age"    ] # logical bat name
[ "batCacheid",      "26"         ] # BBP index
[ "batParentid",     "0"          ] # set if a BAT is a view
[ "head",            "void"       ] # physical head-type
[ "tail",            "int"        ] # physical tail-type
[ "batPersistence",  "persistent" ] # transient/session/persistent
[ "batRestricted",   "updatable"  ] # read-only/append-only/updatable
[ "batDirty",        "clean"      ] # clean/dirty
[ "batRefcnt",       "1"          ] # physical refcount
[ "batLRefcnt",      "1"          ] # logical refcount (total)
[ "batPlevel",       "1"          ] # logical refcount (persistent part)
[ "batSet",          "0"          ] # [head,tail] combinations are unique
[ "batCopiedtodisk", "1"          ] # has been saved or not
@end verbatim

Per column, a number of properties are kept. We only show the head-properties; the tail properties
have the first character of their named replaced by 't' (@emph{sorted}, @emph{tdense}, etc.):

@verbatim
[ "hsorted",         "1"          ] # column is known to be sorted
[ "hdense",          "1"          ] # column is known to be densely ascended
[ "hseqbase",        "0@0"        ] # if densely ascending first value
@end verbatim

As described in the @[<a href="www/gdk.html#mod_1_3_0">GDK Technical Reference</a>@,
BATs store their data in one to six heaps. For each column type that is @emph{variable-sized} - 
like @emph{str} - another
heap might be present (@emph{hheap} and @emph{theap}). 

@verbatim
[ "head.free",    "400004"     ] # occupied size in bytes
[ "head.size",    "400012"     ] # allocated size in bytes
[ "head.maxsize", "400012"     ] # reserver virtual memory in bytes
[ "head.storage", "malloced"   ] # malloced/mmap/priv
@end verbatim

Properties steer the algorithms that Monet uses to execute algebra command. For instance,
the @emph{find(bat[:any_1,:any_2] b, :any_1) :any_2} that looks up a tail value by head,
uses binary search if and only if the head column is sorted (in other cases, hash-lookup
and scan are execution options).

Sometimes new (extension) code contains bugs in the property management, leaving false
properties on produced BATs. You can imagine that later on, this leads to additional
bugs, as e,g, the binary search algorithms will yield erroneous results on a non-sorted
sequence.

@- BAT I/O, Persistency
The BAT Buffer Pool (BBP) manages all known BATs. It administers
their logical and physical names and a reference count. BATs can
either be @emph{persistent} or @emph{transient}. The BBP also manages
swapping on a BAT level:a BAT is either loaded entirely or not.
MAL variables of type @emph{bat} can either be loaded or not. When
the Monet server is started, all BATs are swapped out. If an unloaded
bat-variable is used as an operand in a command, it is automatically
loaded.  The BBP applies a simple but effective LRU based swapping
algorithm. BATs have a @emph{heat}, which drops over time, and is
increased when a BAT is used by some command.  If the size of the
allocated arena gets to be large, BATs may be swapped out.

Note, we should move old-fashioned mil operator definitions
into a separate module.

comment "Makes a BAT very hot for the BBP. The chance of being chosen for

@- Heap Specific Commands
BATs are stored in memory in a number of Heap objects. A heap is nothing
more than a contiguous range of memory. Bats are saved to disk by just writing
away their image. This approach without pointer swizzling makes it possible
to either load an image into an alloced range of memory (STORE_MEM), or
memory-map (STORE_MMAP) an image into virtual memory.

The heap images of a BAT are stored in the @emph{$MONETHOME/dbfarm/$DB/bat/}
directory.  For each bat X, the following heaps are stored:
@table @code
@item[X.buns] 
    an array with all the fixed-size parts of all BUNs.
@item[X.hheap] 
    if the head column contains a variable sized atoms (e.g. str),
then the fixed-size part of a BUN contains an integer byte-offset into
the heap. String values themselves are stored in this the X.hheap.
@item[X.theap] 
    similar to X.hheap, but for the tail column.
@item[X.desc] 
the BAT descriptor. Stores most of the properties of a BAT.
@end table

Each of these heaps can be compressed using the Unix @emph{compress}
utility forming a X.ext.Z file. Monet will automatically decompress it
upon load. Compressed heaps cannot be memory mapped.

@- Synced BATs
The binary model of Monet has important advantages when working in
main-memory. Tables are thin and very efficiently processed. The binary
model gives rise, however, to a larger-than-normal number of join
and semijoin operations. Relations are split up in vertical parts that
are very much related to each other. Then, for instance, multiple
similar semijoins occur on different vertical parts. By equipping the
kernel with knowledge about the correspondence of these parts, we
can greatly limit the amount of work to be done.

When two BATs effectively contain the same sequence of head elements,
we call them 'synced'. This is implemented by storing a very large
OID for each column. An update to the column destroys this OID.
By comparing two OIDs the Monet kernel can very quickly decide that
two columns are exactly equal. All BAT algebra operations propagate
these 'sync' OIDs with their own propagation rules.

@- Shrinking BATs
The SQL front-end uses a multi-BAT representation for relational tables.
This includes a list of tuples to be deleted at some convenient time.
The primitives to consolidate the information consists of shrink()
and reuse(). 
The former simply compresses the underlying BAT skipping over all
oids mentioned as to-be-deleted. The reuse() operator takes the tail
of the BAT an fills all the holes that occur due to the deletion list.
