# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Tue May 23 2023 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- There is now a new option --set tablet_threads=N to limit the number
  of threads used for a COPY INTO from CSV file query.  This option can
  also be set for a specific database using the monetdb command using
  the ncopyintothreads property.
