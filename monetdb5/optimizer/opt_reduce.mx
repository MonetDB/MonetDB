 * @f opt_reduce
 * @a M. Kersten
 * @- Stack Reduction
 * The compilers producing MAL may generate an abundance of temporary variables
 * to hold the result of expressions. This leads to a polution of the
 * runtime stack space, because space should be allocated and garbage
 * collection tests should be performed.
 *
 *
 * The routine @sc{optimizer.reduce()} reduces the number of scratch
 * variables to a minimum. All scratch variables of the same underlying
 * type share the storage space.
 * The result of this optimizer can be seen using the MonetDB debugger,
 * which marks unused variables explicitly.
 * Experience with the SQL front-end shows, that this optimization
 * step easily reduces the stack consumption by over 20%.
 *
 * This optimizer needs further testing.
 * Furthermore, the other optimizers should be careful in setting
 * the isused property, or this property can again be easily derived.
