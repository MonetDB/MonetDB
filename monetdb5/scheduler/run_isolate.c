 * @+ Run isolation
 * Run isolation involves making available a private copy of the MAL
 * block being executed for further massaging, e.g. code replacements
 * or flow-of-control adjustments.
 * These changes should be confined to a single execution. The next time around
 * there may be a different situation to take care off. This is achieved by
 * replacing the current program with a private copy.
 *
 * The easiest way is to duplicate the MAL program and assign the old
 * version to its history. This way any reference to individual instructions
 * remain valid and the result of the schedule action can be inspected
 * with the debugger.
 * Its lifetime then is identical to that of the main program call.
 *
 * @end example
 * This function with its history remain available as long as f()
 * is defined.
