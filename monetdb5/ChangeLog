* Mon Sep 15 2025 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The default_fast and minimal_fast optimizer pipelines have been
  removed.  The default_pipe and minimal_pipe optimizers now use the
  "fast" path always.

* Mon Aug  4 2025 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The type "pcre" has been removed.  There was no way to create a value of
  the type, and there was only one function that used a value of the type.
  That function (pcre.index) has also been removed.
