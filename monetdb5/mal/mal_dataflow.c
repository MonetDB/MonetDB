 * Dataflow processing only works on a code
 * sequence that does not include additional (implicit) flow of control
 * statements and, ideally, consist of expensive BAT operations.
 * The dataflow portion is identified as a guarded block,
 * whose entry is controlled by the function language.dataflow();
 *
 * The dataflow worker tries to follow the sequence of actions
 * as laid out in the plan, but abandon this track when it hits
 * a blocking operator, or an instruction for which not all arguments
 * are available or resources become scarce.
 *
 * The flow graphs is organized such that parallel threads can
 * access it mostly without expensive locking and dependent
 * variables are easy to find..
