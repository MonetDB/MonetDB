 * Running all eligible instructions in parallel creates
 * resource contention. This means we should implement
 * an admission control scheme where threads are temporarily
 * postponed if the claim for memory exceeds a threshold
 * In general such contentions will be hard to predict,
 * because they depend on the algorithm, the input sizes,
 * concurrent use of the same variables, and the output produced.
 *
 * One heuristic is based on calculating the storage footprint
 * of the operands and assuming it preferrably should fit in memory.
 * Ofcourse, there may be intermediate structures being
 * used and the size of the result is not a priori known.
 * For this, we use a high watermark on the amount of
 * physical memory we pre-allocate for the claims.
 *
 * Instructions are eligible to be executed when the
 * total footprint of all concurrent executions stays below
 * the high-watermark or it is the single expensive
 * instruction being started.
 *
 * When we run out of memory, the instruction is delayed.
 * How long depends on the other instructions to free up
 * resources. The current policy simple takes a local
 * decision by delaying the instruction based on its
 * claim of the memory.
 */

/*
 * The memory claim is the estimate for the amount of memory hold.
 * Views are consider cheap and ignored.
 * Given that auxiliary structures are important for performance,
 * we use their maximum as an indication of the memory footprint.
 * An alternative would be to focus solely on the base table cost.
 * (Good for a MSc study)
