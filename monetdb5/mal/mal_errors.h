/*
 * The error strings are geared at answering the question "what happened".
 * Optional information about "why it happened" is added
 * as local strings in the code base with possibly runtime information.
 * Information on "how to avoid it" is sporadically added using expected values.
 *
 * General considerations on error classes are summarized below:
 * MAL_MALLOC_FAIL
 * An operation allocates space for an object failed.
 * Either the pre-requisites are not satisfied, or the system
 * runs low on resources and can not accomodate the object.
 * For failures to create BATs it sometimes indicates that an
 * intermediate BAT size is too large.
 * OPERATION_FAILED
 * Mostly the module and function name are indicative enough.
 * If possible more is said about the error context,
 * informative references to arguments or variables,
 * provided it is produced by the underlying implementation.
 * GDK_EXCEPTION
 * In general these are generated deep inside the kernel.
 * They are captured by the MAL interpreter.
 * SEMANTIC_*
 * The patterns can be used to defer semantic type errors
 * to runtime.
 *
 * Getting all exception strings in one place improves consistency
 * and maintenance.
 *
 * At a later stage we could introduce internationalization support, i.e.
 * use a translation table where needed.
