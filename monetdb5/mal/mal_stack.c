 * @node Stack Management, The MAL Optimizer, Garbage Collection, The MAL Interpreter
 * @+ MAL runtime stack
 * The runtime context of a MAL procedure is allocated on the runtime stack
 * of the corresponding interpreter.
 * Access to the elements in the stack are through index offsets,
 * determined during MAL procedure parsing.
 *
 * The scope administration for MAL procedures is
 * decoupled from their actual runtime behavior. This means we are
 * more relaxed on space allocation, because the size is determined
 * by the number of MAL procedure definitions instead of the runtime
 * calling behavior. (See mal_interpreter for details on value stack
 * management)
 *
 * The variable names and types are kept in the stack to ease debugging.
 * The underlying string value need not be garbage collected.
 * Runtime storage for variables are allocated on the stack of the
 * interpreter thread. The physical stack is often limited in size,
 * which calls for safeguarding their value and garbage collection before returning.
 * A malicious procedure or implementation will lead to memory leakage.
 *
 * A system command (linked C-routine) may be interested in extending the
 * stack. This is precluded, because it could interfere with the recursive
 * calling sequence of procedures. To accommodate the (rare) case, the routine
 * should issue an exception to be handled by the interpreter before retrying.
 * All other errors are turned into an exception, followed by continuing
 * at the exception handling block of the MAL procedure.
 *
 * The interpreter should be protected against physical stack overflow.
 * The solution chosen is to maintain an incremental depth size.
 * Once it exceeds a threshold, we call upon the kernel to
 * ensure we are still within safe bounds.
