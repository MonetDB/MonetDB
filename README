The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group 
(see http://monetdb.cwi.nl).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at http://monetdb.cwi.nl/Download/

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB kernel works together with an
SQL frontend that is in a separate CVS module.

If you got a source distribution, please compile and install MonetDB first,
following the instructions in the file 'HowToStart.rst' (for Unix)
or 'buildtools/doc/windowsbuild.rst' (for Windows).
